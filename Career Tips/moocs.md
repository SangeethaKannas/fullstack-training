#1 Start a Holiday fund

Start your travel planning by starting a holiday fund. Investing will make your money work for you while you work hard towards that holiday.

For short term goals such as these a debt fund can be useful

#2 Befriend and follow your airline

Dynamic pricing is a necessary evil when taking flights and the only way to beat it is by booking early. But sometimes booking early isn’t the best option as you miss out on the various offers which come up during off peak seasons. Today all airlines are active on social media; follow their accounts. They often have preview sales and offers for their newsletter members prior to a public announcement.

Set alerts on airline ticketing aggregator websites for the routes you wish to travel, this will ensure you get information not only on your regular airline but the best rate for that period.

#3 Go off the beaten track

Road travel is always a great hit, with the flexibility it provides to stop and explore as you travel. With your own vehicle, the only major cost tends to be fuel. Water is another great travel option and sea cruises are becoming quite popular and sometimes cheaper too.

#4 Stay down to earth

The best travel experiences are those which happen when you let yourself immerse into the local culture, and staying with the locals is the best way to make that happen.

If you are staying with your family, however, a better option would be to look up home stays on hotel aggregator websites. These could be less expensive than standard star hotels and still give you a more immersive experience. Do, however, check reviews before booking.

#5 Volunteer your time

Many destinations have volunteering vacations where travellers can work in the destinations for any period of time and contribute to the local community. These are budget vacations where the travellers can exchange expertise for food and even stay.

#6 Locals know their food best

Many travelers tend to order their comfort food even at locations where it is nowhere near the local food, like ordering Punjabi food at a restaurant in Chennai. Just because it’s listed on the menu doesn’t mean it’s good.  Always ask the waiter for local delicacies, they give you a flavour of the cuisine as well as are cheaper.

Use restaurant rating apps curated by locals, they will let you find those hidden gems with the best gastronomic experiences.

#7 Be safe and healthy

It is best to stock up on your prescribed medication as it may not be available at your holiday destination or maybe priced exorbitantly.

In foreign locations, healthcare can be expensive without local insurance and it’s best to keep over the counter medication for common ailments. Do keep in mind local laws with regards to medication as what’s over the counter in India might be a restricted drug abroad.

#8 Cash or card for shopping

Travelers usually refrain from carrying a lot of cash on themselves and quite rightly so. Your debit card can be used to withdraw cash in the local currency almost everywhere across the world. However, with a user fee of 3.5% it’s advisable to withdraw larger sums, and rarely if you do so.

When shopping, use credit cards as it’s easier to cancel any transactions in case of any problems with the vendor whereas remittance of money back to your account through a debit card may take time.

#9 Souvenirs, smart or not

Ensure that the souvenirs you buy are unique to the destination and not easily available everywhere. If they are made of precious materials, it is best if they are bought at government approved stores as there is a lesser chance of fraud and even their prices would be regulated.

#10 Don’t get stressed out

Planning for the vacation is known to be as therapeutic as the vacation itself but in a bid to make the best of the vacation, travelers tend to plan too much and end up with a packed itinerary. Be a traveler, enjoy the road less traveled and pick up experiences as you go along.



#1. Quality and Credibility

Shop from a website which has a good reputation in the market. Purchase products of reputed brands, instead of purchasing solely on the basis of offers, discounts and deals.

If an offer seems  too good to be true, it probably is. Get a detailed understanding of the deal to avoid loopholes in it.

#2. Use plastic money instead of Cash on Delivery

For new shoppers, cash on delivery seems like a safe option as they have to dispense with cash only when they have the ordered product in their hands. However, shopping online during sale season using your credit card or debit card will reap you a number of benefits.

First and foremost, using plastic money when making purchases online helps accumulate points on your card, as well as on your registered account on the merchant website. These points can be redeemed for future purchases.

A lot of websites also have a number of different cash back offers and tie ups with various banks. These benefits can be availed using your card.

Warning: Do not go overboard just because it is plastic money. Falling into the credit card debt trap will ruin your future Diwalis.

#3. Informed and comparative shopping

Before you buy a product, find information and product reviews. To get the best possible deal, do a price comparison on different websites.

If you are looking for a particular category of product, list down all the brands of that product with a positive feedback, and compare all the offers available on the listed brands, on various retail websites.

This will help you get the best price and deal on that product without compromising on quality. This option is valid only if you have the time or the inclination as it is quite tedious to compare across websites.

#4. Shop with patience

Don’t make impulsive purchases just because of offers and discounts. Always look to get value for your money, and refrain from buying products you don’t need.

#5. Shipping and other charges

When placing an order online, consider the shipping and other incidental costs being charged on that product. Most websites provide free shipping beyond a certain purchase value.

#6. Promotional and coupon codes

One of the most convenient ways to get promotional and discount codes is by registering on retail websites and subscribing to promotional updates. Go to a search engine and enter the website name along with the phrase “promotional code” or “coupon code”. This could get you codes of various deals and discounts on different products on that website.

All reputed retailers have a page on social media network. Subscribe to or like these pages to get regular information regarding discount codes, special sales and other promotions.

Having access to discount codes and coupons is not enough. Use these coupons strategically and smartly for maximum benefit and savings. This is vital when availing multiple coupons on the same order. When using more than one code, the target must be to get the maximum possible discount on that particular purchase.

#7. Avoid the trap of dynamic pricing

Dynamic pricing is pricing of products done by the retailers based on your location, browsing habits, spending pattern, demand of the product and so on. To avoid falling prey to this pricing system, ensure you clear your browsing history and cookies and log out of your email and social media accounts, before you shop online.

Note: The most important thing you should remember is your spending this festive season should not come at the cost of your retirement, or other financial goals. Spend only what you can afford to after you have saved. You can actually save for “festive spending” by investing in liquid funds.

#1. Subscribe to a finance blog

And No, the blog doesn’t have to be ours. There are quite a few options out there.

How does it help: We are not taught financial education as part of our school curriculum. How can you expect to really grow your wealth without knowing the basics of saving and investing? 

#2. Unlock the power of “72”

How does it help: Unless you know, what is your actual financial worth, how can you think of growing it? Add all your cash, FDs, Mutual Fund, Equity Holdings, and Saved Annual Income. Subtract from this all your debts. This is your financial net worth. Now use the rule of 72. 

The rule of 72 states that if you divide 72 by the compounded annual rate of return, you get a rough estimate of when your money will double. So at 8% (what most debt instruments provide), your money will double in 9 years. But this is not considering inflation. If you want to grow your money faster and in a tax free manner, you might want to consider equity(12%-16%).

#3. Mobilize unused money lying in your bank account and move it into a liquid mutual fund

How does it help: Most people fall in love with their bank balance once it starts approaching a “nice looking” figure. While a big balance looks nice, if you have more money sitting there than you need in a 3 month period, you are losing out on interest.

Move your unused cash into a liquid mutual fund to begin with, and then you can decide whether you want to invest in more long term instruments.

#4. Repeat the above three steps for your family or close friends

How does it help: For most of us financial growth doesn’t happen in isolation. The way our family members grow wealth impacts us as well. Help out your family members and close friends figure out these money hacks and improve their relationship with their own money.

#5. Use MOOCs to up-skill yourself

How does it help: The most effective way to grow your money, is increasing your salary. How much you make is dependent on, among other things, your experience and skills. While experience is something you can’t control, you can always learn new skills related to your work.

MOOCs or Massive open online courses are gaining popularity and acceptance among companies. These courses are often free or priced attractively. Finding and enrolling for a MOOC requires just one lunch break at work.
