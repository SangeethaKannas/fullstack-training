What needs to be measured?

#1: Earnings

Is your salary your only income? Do you have secondary or tertiary sources of income? Your earnings should list every known source of income.

Your earnings information tells you how much you should save and how much you can actually spend.

#2: Expenses

You need to measure exactly where you are spending your money. Beit eating out or paying rent, list your expenses. Analysing your expenses willtell you where your money goes, how much of it goes, when it goes, and why itgoes.

How should you measure? – An action plan

#1. Get Tracking – Having anexcel spreadsheet for this helps a lot, but a simple diary or notebook willalso do. Create an earnings page where you list down all your income sources.The other page will be your expenses page.

#2. Your expense page is the first step to building a good habit – Create an expense page that can be daily or week wise, where you list the following:

Where you spent your money?
When did you spend your money?
How much did you spend?
What did you spend it on?
Was it a need based spend or a want based spend?
It is important that you list your expenses within a couple of days of making them, so that you don’t forget. The more detailed you can get here, the more light you will shed on your financial behaviour. This will include your regular bills and credit card payments.
#3. Check 1 – Are your expenses exceeding your earnings?

Subtract every expense (including your credit card dues) from your earnings. If the result is negative, that is a red flag.

Tools such as your credit card make it easy to overspend by allowing you to defer payments and speed up purchases. If you are in the habit of maxing out your credit card limit every month and struggle with payments, you are probably spending more than you earn.

#4. Check 2 – Are your expenses skewed towards wants rather than needs?

If the answer to the question, “Was it necessary” for most of your expenses was a “No”, then you have a problem. Expenses like eating out too often and splurging on gadgets you don’t really need, lower your wealth in the long run.

It’s critical for you to focus on needs rather than on wants in order to achieve financial freedom faster.

#5. You can use tools too

Your smartphone can help you track your expenses thanks to money tracking apps. Use these to make your money tracking experience smarter. There are apps that can read your SMS and automatically track your expenses for you.


#1. Make an emergency list

Make a complete emergency list including the details and location of all important documents and other possessions. Here is an elaborate and inclusive emergency list –

Safety deposit box key
Important accounts and passwords
Credit and debit cards
Birth certificate
Bank account information
Investment details and relevant information
Current bills and dues
Loans and liabilities
Health care benefits
Life insurance policy
Car insurance policy
Property and fire insurance policy
Will
Living will
Power of attorney
Property ownership information
Car title
Home/Property deed of sale
Income tax returns
Other valuable objects and possessions
People to contact in case of emergency
#2.Organizing financial information

Once a family member or friend knows where to find the important documents and information, it is important that they find it in a systematic and organised manner to be able to understand it completely and correctly.

File all the bills systematically, either alphabetically or chronologically. Match all your bills to your cheque book so that the information regarding monthly expenses and dues is clear.

All cancelled cheques and monthly account statements must be filed properly to keep a track of deposits and income tax deductions.

Make an annual list of investments and sources of income. This list will help to generate the financial information necessary to be reported on income tax forms. Make sure you also list out refunds, if any. This kind of annual list of financial information will help your family members and friends know what to look for in the following year/years.

Such emergency lists and annual list of financial information can be made easily using spreadsheet software. Organise all the information systematically and save it on a hard drive or even a pen-drive.

#3. Handing over the information

Handing over the emergency list in the right manner and to the right person is just as important, as it is to make such a list. If this list is not with the right person and for the right reason, all the effort that went into making the list is in vain.

The emergency list so made can be kept in personal possession, or can be handed over to a trusted family member or friend. Discussing and confiding into at least one trusted family member or friend with the information is very important.

Another option is to hand it over to a trusted third party, like an accountant or an attorney. You can also keep away a copy of the list secured in a safety deposit box. This way only a trusted family member or individual will be able to access your financial information.


#1. Ignoring inflation

When planning finances, the time value of money, or how money loses its value over time is usually ignored by the vast majority. While incorporating increase in income with time, it is vital to consider the increase in expenses and the drop in the value of money thanks to the annual overall increase in prices of common goods and services.

Being over-dependent on “safe” investments such as saving accounts, Bank FDs, and government bonds will lead to your portfolio giving returns at a rate lower than the inflation rate.

Ignore inflation and you might just see your savings slowly erode away while your financial plan goes haywire.

#2. Undervaluing long term expenses when considering retirement

When investing and saving for your retirement, the most important point to consider is the correct valuation and estimation of health care and other long term expenses, owing to the process of aging.

Health care and other long term costs increase with age, and incorporating these expenses correctly is necessary for an effective retirement plan. Not doing so would compromise your savings and finances during your years of zero income.

#3. Not saving enough or investing when you are young

The initial years of your investing life must be focused on savings. The rate of savings during that time should be more than the rate of returns.

An effective investment plan can be made, gradually, once you are saving consistently and as much as you can in those initial years. Remember, the earlier you start, the more time compounding has to double or triple your money.

Savings should be made not just by controlling daily expenditures, but also by considering the money paid towards taxes. Figure out a good plan to maximize your savings during the initial years of your investment life. If you are in a higher income category, tax savings (through the correct choice of investments) should be important.

#4. Investing too aggressively or too conservatively

A common financial advice is that people falling into the age group of 20-40 years should invest aggressively. Although this idea makes sense, it is necessary to invest using reasonable logic and not to be blind towards risk. Exposing yourself to more risk than your goals allow for may end with you losing too much and, move you completely away from investing in the future.

Just as being too aggressive is not recommended, being too conservative when investing has its downside too. Being too conservative when investing can lead to loss in the value of your money. Stocking up cash in your savings account will bring down its value over a period of time. Rs 100 today would be practically worth half its value, in less than a decade, if it stays just in your bank account.

It is important to invest across investment options with varying degrees of risk, to make your money grow at a consistent and an increasing rate.

#5. Making financial planning all about investing

It is a common mistake to believe that financial planning is all about investing. It must be noted that investing is just one part of an ideal financial plan that you must make to meet your long term goals.

It is important to focus on day-to-day budgeting, appropriate insurance cover (for everything of real value to you, including your health) and smart tax decisions, to make an effective and appropriately long term financial plan.

#6. Thinking that Insurance is about saving tax

Far too many individuals make this common mistake in India. Insurance of any kind is an expense and not an “investment”. Buying insurance (life or health) just to save tax is one of the worst ways you can spend your money, unless you actually need the insurance.

Health Insurance in today’s expensive healthcare scenario is a must. Life Insurance is a must only if you have dependents. Think about the utility of the insurance first before you think about the tax benefits.



#1. Savings

You should start by trying to maintain an amount equal to a month’s expenses in your account. Your 20s may seem like an odd time to think about saving, but the earlier you start, the faster your money grows. Set an agenda and identify your goals, whether long term or short term.

How much to save?

Save 30-40% of your monthly salary: The more money you make, the higher your expenses are likely to be. Lifestyle costs tend to go up with income. The key is to save smartly and spend wisely.

How to save – Do these to save as much as 40% of your income

Keep track of your expenditure. Ensure your expenses don’t exceed your post savings income.
Avoid going to expensive eating joints. Leave fine dining for special occasions unless you like being in debt. Alternatives could include organizing a house party or cook at home.
Stay with family at home if you have the option. You can save on rent and utility bills, which is a major cost for most people in their 20s. This way, you can also help out your family by paying utility bills, if not rent, and hence share responsibilities.
Try make use of public transport facilities like metros or buses. Carpooling is a good option if you have access to it.
Avoid buying things you don't need. For example, don't invest money in hobby classes you would not be able to attend.
# 2. Investing:
Early in your working life it is very important to make a few but smart, long-term investments. Craft your financial plan, identify your long-term and short-term goals, and choose appropriate investments to match your goals. Here are a few tips to get you started:

Employee Provident Fund: One of the most effective ways to save, EPF mandates at least 12% of your basic salary and a matching contribution by your employer, hence making a subscriber to the EPF able to accumulate a decent amount by the time he retires. It is normally a mandatory deduction and thus automatic savings.
Equity Linked Savings Scheme: ELSS is a form of Equity Mutual Fund, which invests in stocks of listed companies, and which not only helps you save tax, but also gives you an opportunity to grow your money. With ELSS, you can aim to earn tax free returns. It also has the shortest lock-in period (as compared to other tax saving investment options) of only 3 years.
Debt Funds (short-term goals): Debt funds are mutual funds that invest in fixed income securities like bonds and treasury bills. They are tax efficient and hence give much higher post-tax returns as compared to Fixed Deposits, more so, if you are in a higher tax bracket.
Equity Mutual Funds: Among the best means to build a retirement fund, Equity Mutual Funds invest in the shares of companies and have many advantages, like expert management and some of the highest long term returns.



#1 Start a Holiday fund

Start your travel planning by starting a holiday fund. Investing will make your money work for you while you work hard towards that holiday.

For short term goals such as these a debt fund can be useful

#2 Befriend and follow your airline

Dynamic pricing is a necessary evil when taking flights and the only way to beat it is by booking early. But sometimes booking early isn’t the best option as you miss out on the various offers which come up during off peak seasons. Today all airlines are active on social media; follow their accounts. They often have preview sales and offers for their newsletter members prior to a public announcement.

Set alerts on airline ticketing aggregator websites for the routes you wish to travel, this will ensure you get information not only on your regular airline but the best rate for that period.

#3 Go off the beaten track

Road travel is always a great hit, with the flexibility it provides to stop and explore as you travel. With your own vehicle, the only major cost tends to be fuel. Water is another great travel option and sea cruises are becoming quite popular and sometimes cheaper too.

#4 Stay down to earth

The best travel experiences are those which happen when you let yourself immerse into the local culture, and staying with the locals is the best way to make that happen.

If you are staying with your family, however, a better option would be to look up home stays on hotel aggregator websites. These could be less expensive than standard star hotels and still give you a more immersive experience. Do, however, check reviews before booking.

#5 Volunteer your time

Many destinations have volunteering vacations where travellers can work in the destinations for any period of time and contribute to the local community. These are budget vacations where the travellers can exchange expertise for food and even stay.

#6 Locals know their food best

Many travelers tend to order their comfort food even at locations where it is nowhere near the local food, like ordering Punjabi food at a restaurant in Chennai. Just because it’s listed on the menu doesn’t mean it’s good.  Always ask the waiter for local delicacies, they give you a flavour of the cuisine as well as are cheaper.

Use restaurant rating apps curated by locals, they will let you find those hidden gems with the best gastronomic experiences.

#7 Be safe and healthy

It is best to stock up on your prescribed medication as it may not be available at your holiday destination or maybe priced exorbitantly.

In foreign locations, healthcare can be expensive without local insurance and it’s best to keep over the counter medication for common ailments. Do keep in mind local laws with regards to medication as what’s over the counter in India might be a restricted drug abroad.

#8 Cash or card for shopping

Travelers usually refrain from carrying a lot of cash on themselves and quite rightly so. Your debit card can be used to withdraw cash in the local currency almost everywhere across the world. However, with a user fee of 3.5% it’s advisable to withdraw larger sums, and rarely if you do so.

When shopping, use credit cards as it’s easier to cancel any transactions in case of any problems with the vendor whereas remittance of money back to your account through a debit card may take time.

#9 Souvenirs, smart or not

Ensure that the souvenirs you buy are unique to the destination and not easily available everywhere. If they are made of precious materials, it is best if they are bought at government approved stores as there is a lesser chance of fraud and even their prices would be regulated.

#10 Don’t get stressed out

Planning for the vacation is known to be as therapeutic as the vacation itself but in a bid to make the best of the vacation, travelers tend to plan too much and end up with a packed itinerary. Be a traveler, enjoy the road less traveled and pick up experiences as you go along.



#1. Quality and Credibility

Shop from a website which has a good reputation in the market. Purchase products of reputed brands, instead of purchasing solely on the basis of offers, discounts and deals.

If an offer seems  too good to be true, it probably is. Get a detailed understanding of the deal to avoid loopholes in it.

#2. Use plastic money instead of Cash on Delivery

For new shoppers, cash on delivery seems like a safe option as they have to dispense with cash only when they have the ordered product in their hands. However, shopping online during sale season using your credit card or debit card will reap you a number of benefits.

First and foremost, using plastic money when making purchases online helps accumulate points on your card, as well as on your registered account on the merchant website. These points can be redeemed for future purchases.

A lot of websites also have a number of different cash back offers and tie ups with various banks. These benefits can be availed using your card.

Warning: Do not go overboard just because it is plastic money. Falling into the credit card debt trap will ruin your future Diwalis.

#3. Informed and comparative shopping

Before you buy a product, find information and product reviews. To get the best possible deal, do a price comparison on different websites.

If you are looking for a particular category of product, list down all the brands of that product with a positive feedback, and compare all the offers available on the listed brands, on various retail websites.

This will help you get the best price and deal on that product without compromising on quality. This option is valid only if you have the time or the inclination as it is quite tedious to compare across websites.

#4. Shop with patience

Don’t make impulsive purchases just because of offers and discounts. Always look to get value for your money, and refrain from buying products you don’t need.

#5. Shipping and other charges

When placing an order online, consider the shipping and other incidental costs being charged on that product. Most websites provide free shipping beyond a certain purchase value.

#6. Promotional and coupon codes

One of the most convenient ways to get promotional and discount codes is by registering on retail websites and subscribing to promotional updates. Go to a search engine and enter the website name along with the phrase “promotional code” or “coupon code”. This could get you codes of various deals and discounts on different products on that website.

All reputed retailers have a page on social media network. Subscribe to or like these pages to get regular information regarding discount codes, special sales and other promotions.

Having access to discount codes and coupons is not enough. Use these coupons strategically and smartly for maximum benefit and savings. This is vital when availing multiple coupons on the same order. When using more than one code, the target must be to get the maximum possible discount on that particular purchase.

#7. Avoid the trap of dynamic pricing

Dynamic pricing is pricing of products done by the retailers based on your location, browsing habits, spending pattern, demand of the product and so on. To avoid falling prey to this pricing system, ensure you clear your browsing history and cookies and log out of your email and social media accounts, before you shop online.

Note: The most important thing you should remember is your spending this festive season should not come at the cost of your retirement, or other financial goals. Spend only what you can afford to after you have saved. You can actually save for “festive spending” by investing in liquid funds.

#1. Subscribe to a finance blog

And No, the blog doesn’t have to be ours. There are quite a few options out there.

How does it help: We are not taught financial education as part of our school curriculum. How can you expect to really grow your wealth without knowing the basics of saving and investing? 

#2. Unlock the power of “72”

How does it help: Unless you know, what is your actual financial worth, how can you think of growing it? Add all your cash, FDs, Mutual Fund, Equity Holdings, and Saved Annual Income. Subtract from this all your debts. This is your financial net worth. Now use the rule of 72. 

The rule of 72 states that if you divide 72 by the compounded annual rate of return, you get a rough estimate of when your money will double. So at 8% (what most debt instruments provide), your money will double in 9 years. But this is not considering inflation. If you want to grow your money faster and in a tax free manner, you might want to consider equity(12%-16%).

#3. Mobilize unused money lying in your bank account and move it into a liquid mutual fund

How does it help: Most people fall in love with their bank balance once it starts approaching a “nice looking” figure. While a big balance looks nice, if you have more money sitting there than you need in a 3 month period, you are losing out on interest.

Move your unused cash into a liquid mutual fund to begin with, and then you can decide whether you want to invest in more long term instruments.

#4. Repeat the above three steps for your family or close friends

How does it help: For most of us financial growth doesn’t happen in isolation. The way our family members grow wealth impacts us as well. Help out your family members and close friends figure out these money hacks and improve their relationship with their own money.

#5. Use MOOCs to up-skill yourself

How does it help: The most effective way to grow your money, is increasing your salary. How much you make is dependent on, among other things, your experience and skills. While experience is something you can’t control, you can always learn new skills related to your work.

MOOCs or Massive open online courses are gaining popularity and acceptance among companies. These courses are often free or priced attractively. Finding and enrolling for a MOOC requires just one lunch break at work.
