Round 1 (Basic JS Round):

ü§ù Started with introductions and discussed my work experience.
üíª Technical questions covered Promises, asynchronous behavior, and generator functions.
üîç Asked to write a polyfill for the reduce function (already practiced!).
üñáÔ∏è Question on object manipulation (specific details not recalled).
üí¨ In-depth discussions and arguments on pure functions and currying concepts.

After completing the first round, I was given a half-hour break and asked to rejoin the same link for the next round.

Round 2 (Security and React):

üîí Focus on web security, including knowledge about attacks and defense mechanisms.
üõ°Ô∏è Questioned about web security fundamentals, such as common attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and ransomware.
üí° Discussed the security principles followed in my organization and the security considerations while coding on the frontend.
‚öõÔ∏è Explored React's lifecycle methods and their significance in maintaining secure web applications.
üìö Asked about component design considerations, such as minimizing security vulnerabilities and ensuring data privacy.

‚úçÔ∏è Requested to write a generic memoization function to test problem-solving skills.

I honestly admitted that I was familiar with the terms but lacked practical experience. However, I expressed my willingness to learn and enhance my understanding of security.

Soon after, the HR representative joined the call and informed me that if I were selected, I would receive an invitation for a managerial interview within the next two hours. At that moment, I felt burnt out and uncertain about my chances of being selected, considering my performance in the security-related questions.

Managerial Interview and HR Wrap-Up:

üíº Interviewed by the manager who explained the project and asked about a feature I was proud of.
üìä Provided a detailed explanation and even drew a flow chart to illustrate the feature's flow.
üí¨ Discussion about conflict resolution within a team and handling team dynamics.
ü§ù HR informed me that if selected, I would receive an invitation for the next round within two hours.
