### Work Culture
1. Your boss excitedly tells your team she's taking her son to football practice early on Wednesday afternoons.
2. You hear laughter, often.
3. Innovation and failures are welcomed, not feared.
4. The company handbook is written in simple, plain language.
5. Your colleagues come from different backgrounds and nationalities.
6. Meetings start on time.
7. Your kids are welcome to drop-in at any time.
8. You're rarely the smartest person in a meeting.
9. Gossip is shut down quickly.
10. You're trusted to work from home. 

### Cab Driving mentality
Instead of asking us where we want to go, please start asking the drivers where they are going and if we can tag along 🙏🏻

Because this is my everyday situation with your app:
1. Doesn't get a cab for 15 mins
2. Keeps shuffling between Uber Ola desperately
3. Finally gets a cab

Then this happens:
1. Driver cancels instantly
2. Driver doesn't pick up the calls and does not move
3. Driver picks up the call, asks where you want to go, and cancels

If the driver doesn't move, we are forced to cancel, and you charge us 🤷🏻‍♀️

And what's with the massive inflation? Your prices are always 2x the actual cost.
