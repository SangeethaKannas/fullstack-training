1. Work hard. There is no substitute for a good work ethic.

2. Be a problem solver. Anyone can point out a problem, but not everyone can solve it.

3. Be resilient. Challenges and obstacles will come your way; don’t run from them, conquer them.

4. Learn new things. The world is changing quickly, you can’t rely on past experiences or education.

5. Know yourself. Being self-aware of your strengths and weaknesses is key to success.

6. Put people first. Even during tough times, always take care of those around you.

#1. Buy experiences not things

Experts believe that spending money on experiences such as a vacation or adventure sports, produces happiness that lasts longer compared to spending the same money on physical things. The reasoning is that experiences stay in the memory longer, and can’t be compared with someone else’s experience.

So the next time you want to remember fondly what you spent your money on, try a road trip instead of a new smartphone whose technology will be obsolete in less than a year.

#2. Spend on others

Research has found that spending money on others, generally friends or family, helps you derive greater happiness as compared to spending on yourself. So treat your loved ones to a great gift and let their happiness add to your own.

Giving to charity and sharing your wealth with those who need help, is another great way to derive meaningful joy.

#3. Buy happiness in bite sized pieces

Small indulgences such as a one off ice-cream or even a head massage the next time you go to a hair salon are likely to give you greater joy than a one-off big ticket purchase. The key is to go for small things that give you several small bursts of happiness.

#4. Buy what you like, not to keep up with others

Buying based on what you like versus trying to keep up with your peers has been shown to provide greater joy. Your individuality, when it reflects in the things you buy, tends to bring greater satisfaction to you.

#5. Buy more free time

Spend on outsourcing things which save you time such as on hiring a maid or a cook. You will have more time to spend on things you like to do rather than boring chores which you would rather avoid.

#6. Spend on your passion or hobbies

Spending on something you enjoy doing, such as spending on a sports club membership, Lego sets, or even video games, can directly enhance your happiness.

### Experience
The first time nearbuy went to hire from ISB, we had to find a way of creating a buzz on the campus.

We weren’t a well known brand. And competition for talent was intense.

So during the pre-placement talk, we told students three things.

1. Your resume SHOULD NOT be in the ISB resume template.
2. Add color to your resume.
3. On the resume, name someone else from the batch who you think is better than you, for the role you are applying for.

It was super interesting to see the reactions.

1. While some students were relieved that they did not have to follow the template, some were jittery. Because now there was no standard way of doing the task!
2. Almost everyone was curious as to “what does color mean?” This led to the most joyful submissions: PDFs. Comic books. Highlights.
We sensed liberation!

3. We collated the frequently recurring names, and if they hadn’t applied reached out to them, while the submissions were on.

“7 students who have applied think you will be better than them at this role. Do you wish to consider applying?”
In a batch of 770 people, we had 380 students applying!
It made our job of shortlisting a lot harder, but we weren’t complaining.
This is what we signed up for!

We eventually hired 4 product managers. And all 4 of them stayed with us for 3+ years!

There is a thing about templates.
They are very seductive.
They give an illusion of safety.
They give an illusion of low risk.

So a lot of us fall for them.

Not just in our resumes.
In our lives.

Think about it.
How many of us are living our life like a template?

If Class tenth marks > 90%, then science
If parents = engineers, then engineering
If parents = business, then study commerce
If engineer = yes, then MBA
If age > 25, get married jaldi jaldi
If married > 2 years, sunao khushkhabri to the world

All of these are nothing but templates.

And whenever I think of templates, I am reminded of a powerful thing that Steve Jobs once said during an interview.

"Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use."

But most of us do not change the rules.

We play a game designed and rules laid out by someone else.
And thus the rules laid out by someone else.

The world does not need another template.
The world needs a rebel.

1. He was always punctual. I cannot remember a day that he was late even by a minute. He may come few minutes early but never late. Respect for time is very important to build a great reputation.

2. He was always regular. In 8 years, he has never taken a single day off. Very rarely he needs a leave but always informs well in advance. Commitment and dependability is very important in customer service.

3. Though he was from Orissa, he could cook all cuisines very well, specially South Indian. Having diverse skills is super important to last long in any business.

4. He never asked for a hike in all the years. Of course, we used to hike regularly but he never expressed any dissatisfaction in his salary or payments. His work was his top priority. It's not always that money can motivate performance. There has to be immense passion to be at your best.

5. He would always ask feedback. Everytime he did a new menu, he checked in if we liked it. Sometimes, when we have critical feedback for anything he cooked, he took it positively and tried to improve. Being open to constructive feedback is key to improve continuously. Also it's always important to collect feedback proactively.

1) Staying in your comfort zone.
2) Bad or a toxic circle
3) Negative mindset and limiting beliefs.
4) Herd Mentality.
5) Not investing enough in skill enhancement and learning.
6) Not focusing on Personal development and branding.

⭐️ Do less up-front: don't load latest content until needed by the user.
⭐️ Be really lazy: don't fetch more than needed content until the user needs them.
⭐️ Do as little as possible: don't pre-ready content unless user is highly likely to use it.
⭐️ Core user intent first: optimize for primary user scenario first, moving everything else out of the way.
⭐️ Be a step ahead of the user: using analytics to only prefetch the most likely next move of the user.

You might be wondering why there's a picture of a crocodile.

Fun facts: Crocodiles are considered to be one of the laziest and most energy efficient animals in the world. Some large salt-water crocs can last as much as a year without food and can drop their heart rate to as low as 2-3 beats per minute.

Consistent actions (short term) ⇒ Crack marketing channels for your startup (long term)

1. Write 1 post every day ⇒ Social media following

2. Publish 1 article every 2-3 days ⇒ Traffic via SEO

3. Write 1 newsletter every week ⇒ Email audience


Now, become obsessive about your time.
Do your work diligently, but spare as much time as you can after that. Your nights, weekends, holidays. Whatever you can manage.
And use that time to explore.
Explore different things that you feel you could be good at.

We mostly do it wrong.
We quit our jobs.
And put the pressure on a new thing to make us money.
When it is way too early for it to do so.

Enjoy the exploration.
And if you find that thing that you truly enjoy and are good at - you will eventually find a way to make money from it.

Which is when you can say no to your job.

What often comes as lack of clarity, goes away when we free ourselves from any pressure to make things work. Which is when things do work out!

At times all you need is not only to push yourself a little bit more, but to accept that you’re facing a burnout, a creative block, a gloomy day to not do anything else but to wake up & still make yourself a plate of good food, turn on your laptop just to browse through your emails & do nothing else… allow yourself a good afternoon nap on a Saturday afternoon & come back to LinkedIn to share your burnout with your connections!

Burnout is real. The only way to overcome is to accept it. Allow yourself a creative break. Sleep enough. Drink water. That’s it.
The 3 crucial lessons nobody taught me but I learnt with experience :

> Growth comes when you push yourself out of that comfort bubble. 
New things might seem daunting at times but that’s when you will accommodate your own abilities to fit in the new ones. 

> Your network can decide how far you go.
Your circle of people can define the motivation inside you, the goals you set, the vision you have. Everything is influenced. So, make sure it’s all influenced by the right people. 

> Self- worth is subjective. Not a metric for comparison.
A lot of variables contribute to your journey. You can’t compare each and everything. Accept the unique path you are on and move ahead taking inspiration from others’ journeys.
