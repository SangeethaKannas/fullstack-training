Recently, I interviewed and got 7 offers within two months of preparation and accepted Senior Software Engineer position at LinkedIn. I want to share some useful resources which might help you to land your dream job 

1. Confidence is the key. Don’t jump into the interview process when you are not fully prepared. 

2. Rather than doing 1000s of leetcode (https://lnkd.in/gyRnXuHQ), do few examples and understand the patterns which will help you to crack any problem. Also, think about all edge cases and test cases. 

3. At the end, spend some time thinking about  time and space complexity. It gets tricky with graph and tree problems.  

4. Think about the possible use cases of the given problem, for example, flood fill is nothing but the paint app and try to explain that to the interviewer. 

5. Create a Google doc and list down all recent/interesting project you worked on. Start with design, implementation, testing, monitoring, your contribution and ask yourself what questions a person can ask if he/she doesn’t have any idea about the project. This will also help you during the system design interview.

6. Also, create a Google doc for behavior questions (https://lnkd.in/gPp8iE_x) and write down what was the situation, what was your task, what action you took and what was the result. Read more about the STAR approach. Companies like Amazon, pays more attention to these questions so be well-prepared.  

7. Do practice interviews with your friends and peers, and take feedback seriously. 

8. At the end of an onsite interview, make a list of what went well and where you need to put more attention and work on it.  

9. While practicing system design, try to relate things with your current or past experience. Like how server side configuration has been set up or how APIs are implemented in your current project. This way you will remember things easily.    

10. Before your onsite interview, visit Glassdoor (https://lnkd.in/gwKXeYQA) and read about other’s experiences. That will give you an idea on what to expect. 

11. Lastly, don’t get dejected by rejections. Sometimes it looks difficult, but with enough practice and hard work, you will get your dream job.

All the very best, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any help on anything.
