‚óè What's the console output of?
const a = {};
const b = { key: 'b' };
const c = { key: 'c' };
a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;
console.log(a[c]);
Answer : -
Object keys are automatically converted into
strings.
We are trying to set an ***object as a key*** to
object a, with the value of 123.
However, when we stringify an object, it
becomes "[object Object]".
So what we are saying here, is that a["[object
Object]"] = 123. Then,
we can try to do the same again.
c is another object that we are implicitly
stringifying.
So then, a["[object Object]"] = 456. Then, we log
a[b],
which is actually a["[object Object]"].
We just set that to 456, so it returns 456. */
