● Write a program sorting in javascript

for (let j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {
if(arr[i] < arr[j]) {
let temp = arr[i];
arr[i] = arr[j];
arr[j] = temp;
}
}
}
console.log("Elements of array sorted in
ascending order:");
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
console.log("Elements of array sorted
in ascending order"

● What will be output ?
var num = 4;
function outer() {
var num = 2;

num++;
var num = 3;
console.log("num", num);
}
inner();
}
outer();
function sayHi() {
return (() => 0)();
}
● What's the console output of?
const a = {};
const b = { key: 'b' };
const c = { key: 'c' };
a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;
console.log(a[c]);
Answer : -
Object keys are automatically converted into
strings.
We are trying to set an ***object as a key*** to
object a, with the value of 123.
However, when we stringify an object, it
becomes "[object Object]".
So what we are saying here, is that a["[object
Object]"] = 123. Then,
we can try to do the same again.
c is another object that we are implicitly
stringifying.
So then, a["[object Object]"] = 456. Then, we log
a[b],
which is actually a["[object Object]"].
We just set that to 456, so it returns 456. */
● Write a program to make polyfill for map
method in javascript
Array.prototype.mymap = function (cb) {
let temp = [];
for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
temp.push(cb(this[i]));
}
return temp;
};
const arr = [2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = arr.mymap((num) => {
return num * 5;
});
console.log("result", result);
● Write a program to make polyfill for filter
method in javascript
Array.prototype.myFilter = function (cb) {
let temp = [];
for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
if (cb(this[i], i, this)) temp.push(cb(this[i]));
}
return temp;
};
const arr = [2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log("arr", arr);
const data = arr.filter((num) => {
return num > 2;
});
console.log("resultnumber", data);
● Write a program to make polyfill for
reduce method in javascript
Array.prototype.myReducer = function (cb, initialValue) {
var accumulator = initialValue;
for (i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
accumulator = accumulator ? cb(this[i], i, this) : this[i];
}
return accumulator;
};
const arr = [2, 3, 4, 5];
const sumOfArray = arr.myReducer((accu, curr, index, arr) => {
return (accu += curr);
}, 0);
console.log("polyfil", sumOfArray);
