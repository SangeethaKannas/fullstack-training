Typescript Vs Javascript	
	When it comes to building scalable applications, using TypeScript with React.js can be a game-changer. 	TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to the equation, making code more 	reliable and easier to maintain.

As a TypeScript enthusiast, I've found that integrating it with React.js has significantly improved my projects' readability and stability. Here are some key benefits:

	1. Enhanced code quality: Utilizing TypeScript's typing system, I can catch errors during development 	rather than in production. Plus, it helps me write cleaner, more organized code.

	2. Improved developer experience: Leveraging TypeScript's IntelliSense support in my favorite editor, 	VSCode, provides autocomplete and inline error feedback ‚Äì making development a breeze!

	3. Seamless integration: TypeScript works perfectly with React.js' JSX, allowing me to create type-	safe components that ensure my app's components are always used correctly.


Month 1 - Forget about degrees

Skills are easier to learn now than ever. Pick a high-value service that interests you, learn for free on YouTube, and find advanced courses online. Do this till you‚Äôre confident you can get results.


Month 2 - Stop looking for jobs

Once you have a skill, don‚Äôt think about money initially. You need to find clients willing to take a bet on a newbie (you), and you can do this only by working for free or dirt cheap. Do this till you have a success story.


Month 3 & 4 - Scale your business

Use your case study to pitch to prospects in the same industry, increasing your prices by 10% for each one. Do this till you can‚Äôt take on any more clients yourself, and need to hire help.


Month 4 - Build an team

Hire talented people to help with the workload, and specialists to improve the quality of your services. Do this till your agency can run itself without your micro-management.


Month 5 & 6 - Focus on business development

While your business runs itself (with your oversight), your priorities should be client acquisition, brand building and growing your business. Do this till you build a successful agency, and keep scaling up!

‚Ä¢ HTML
‚Ä¢ CSS
‚Ä¢ JavaScript
‚Ä¢ Web Fundamentals

In every Unicorn Companies I interviewed, they stressed more questions on the above topics.

Now let‚Äôs decode on fundamental questions patterns,

1Ô∏è‚É£ HTML

(Scope of questions are less here, but can be asked many general stuff)

‚Ä¢ Block, Inline, Inline-Block
‚Ä¢ Event handling on elements
‚Ä¢ Semantic Elements
‚Ä¢ Impact of display none, hidden, opacity

2Ô∏è‚É£ CSS

‚Ä¢ Box sizing
‚Ä¢ Box model
‚Ä¢ Positions
‚Ä¢ CSS units
‚Ä¢ Selector specificity
‚Ä¢ Flexbox

3Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript

‚Ä¢ Hoisting - Functions, Variables
‚Ä¢ Lexical scope
‚Ä¢ Closures
‚Ä¢ Callback & Microtask Queue
‚Ä¢ Promises, Callbacks, Async/Await
‚Ä¢ Execution Context, Event Loop
‚Ä¢ ‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword
‚Ä¢ Prototypes

4Ô∏è‚É£ Web Fundamentals

‚Ä¢ Async, Defer scripts
‚Ä¢ DOM manipulation
‚Ä¢ Security - CORS, CSRF
‚Ä¢ Events - Bubble, Capture, Target, Delegation
‚Ä¢ Storage - Cookies, Local, Session
‚Ä¢ HTTP - Methods, Status, Headers, Query Params

I didn‚Äôt talk of React yet.

I don‚Äôt discourage learning React. Do explore React & it‚Äôs internals, but there are very slim chances to ask, ‚ÄúExplain how React Fiber works‚Äù in Interviews.

You just need to learn & know how to work on React, and it‚Äôs conceptual workflows.

If you‚Äôve noticed in most Machine Coding rounds, Interviewers encourage to use any Library/Framework of your choice (or even Vanilla JS)

Note: It‚Äôs a different thing if you‚Äôre targeting for a dedicated ‚ÄòReact Developer‚Äô role.

You can checkout my One Stop Frontend Projects üî• and join 100+ learners.

Where I‚Äôve taught all of the above fundamentals in depth & applied in 3 Frontend Intensive Projects.

1. BLACKBOX / Copilot
AI-powered coding assistants that will help you write code faster and better. Autocomplete and search functionalities are an absolute game-changer.

2. Locofy
Easily turn designs into code. Save weeks worth of time by converting Figma or XD designs into production-ready code.

3. Figstack
Easily have code explained to yourself and your team in plain language, translate snippets of code from one coding language to another and easily write documentation based on code snippets.

4. Jam
Easily record your screen to log bugs. Jam will automatically track your console logs, network request, device details etc.

5. Wappalyzer
Find out the underlying technologies that are powering any website. Less functional but it's fun to figure out what your favourite websites are using.

6. ChatGPT
We've all heard of it. We should all be using it. Enough said.
