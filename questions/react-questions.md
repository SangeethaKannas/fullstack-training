Q1: What are React hooks? Explain the difference between useState and useEffect.

A1: React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.useState is used to manage state, while useEffect is used to handle side effects like fetching data or subscribing to events.

üí° Code Example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
 document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);

üß© Q2: What is the Context API in React? How can it be used to manage global state?

A2: Context API provides a way to share data between components without passing it through props.It's useful for managing global state.You create a context using createContext and provide it at a higher level.Consumers can access the context using useContext.

üåç Code Example:
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
 return (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
   <Component />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
 );
}

function Component() {
 const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
 // Use theme value here
}

‚öõÔ∏è Q3: What are React render props? How do they enable component composition and code reusability?

A3: Render props is a pattern where a component accepts a function as a prop and calls it to render content.It enables component composition and code reusability by allowing components to share their internal state or behavior with other components.

üîÑ Code Example:
function MouseTracker({ render }) {
 const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

 useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
   setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  };

  window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);

  return () => {
   window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
  };
 }, []);

 return render(position);
}

üñ•Ô∏è Q4: How can you optimize performance in a React application? Discuss techniques like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading.

A4: Performance optimization techniques include memoization with useMemo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary recalculations, code splitting to split the bundle into smaller chunks, and lazy loading to load components or resources only when needed.

‚ö°Ô∏è Code Example:
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
 // Handle click event
}, []);

    A web store uses the following React component for showing suggestions while users are typing product names:

const ProductSearch = (props) => {

  let [name, setName] = React.useState();

  let [suggestions, setSuggestions] = React.useState([]);


  React.useEffect(() => {

    if(name !== undefined) {

      props.requestSuggestions(name, setSuggestions);

    }

  }, [name]);

 

  const onChange = (event) => {

    setName(event.target.value);

  };


  return (

    <div>

      <label htmlFor={"search"}>Product name</label>

      <input onChange={onChange} id={"search"} list={"suggestions"}></input>

      <datalist id={"suggestions"}>

        { suggestions.map((suggestion) => <option>{ suggestion }</option>) }

      </datalist>

    </div>

  );

};

Select all the correct answers.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) If the props.requestSuggestions function invokes setSuggestions using [name, suggestions] as the second parameter of React.useEffect, the component will be rerendered after each React.useEffect call.

2) On the first component render, the value of the suggestions variable will be [].

3) If the requestSuggestions function is async and does not call the setSuggestion function immediately, it will throw an error.

4) The function passed to React.useEffect should call ReactDOM.render so that changes to the suggestions variable are visible.

5) If the requestSuggestions function calls setSuggestions with two items, they will be shown in the datalist.

6) Calling setName("10") will make the input field have 10 as its value.

The following React component is used as a login form for a website:

function LoginForm(props) {

  let [username, setUsername] = React.useState("");

  let [password, setPassword] = React.useState(null);


  return (<div>

    <input onChange={(event) => setUsername(event.target.value)} name="username"></input>

    <input onChange={(event) => setPassword(event.target.value)} name="password" type="password"></input>

    <button onClick={() => props.login(username, password)}>Login</button>

  </div>);

}

Select all the true statements.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) When the component is first created, the username variable‚Äôs value will be null.

2) Pasting into the input field named "password" will change the value of the password variable to the value of the input field.

3) The call to props.login will always be made with "" as the username and null as the password.

4) LoginForm is a functional component.

5) If the setUsername function and all its references are renamed, calling it will not change the username variable.

6) The parent component should pass a prop function named login to handle the click event on the "Login" button.

















Consider the following React component which is used to validate emails in forms:
class EmailInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { inputValue: '', isValid: false };
  }

  render() {
    let onChange = (event) => {
      this.setState({inputValue: event.target.value}); 
      if(event.target.value.includes("@")) {
        this.setState({isValid: true});
      } else {
        this.setState({isValid: false});
      }
    };

    return <div><input onChange={onChange} /><p>{ this.state.isValid ? '' : this.props.message }</p></div>
  }
}
A new component, Form, was recently added to the app. Form will always be a parent component to EmailInput and make decisions based on data from it.
Select the minimal changes so that the state is lifted up from EmailInput to the Form component.
(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) The inputValue state should be kept in the Form component and passed as a prop to the EmailInput component.
2) The Form component should pass a callback as a prop to update the state of isValid and inputValue.
3) The onChange event handler should invoke the callback passed from the Form component to update the values.
4) The render function should be passed as a prop from Form to the EmailInput component.
5) The message props should be changed from props to state inside the EmailInput components.
6) The conditional in JSX should be replaced by this.parent.state.isValid.

Finish the SubscribeButton component so that it renders the following HTML:

<button>Click to subscribe!</button>

After the button is clicked, it should no longer be visible and should render the following:

<p>Thank you for subscribing!</p>

The component should use React Hooks.

HTML5, CSS3, React v18 (available as React and ReactDOM)

 

// React is loaded and is available as React and ReactDOM

// imports should NOT be used

const SubscribeButton = (props) => {

  const [isClicked, setIsClicked] = React.useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => {  setIsClicked(true); }

  return { isClicked ? <button onClick={handleClick} >Click to subscribe!</button>
		      :  <p>Thank you for subscribing!</p>
 };

};

document.body.innerHTML = "<div id='root' />";

ReactDOM.render(<SubscribeButton />, document.getElementById("root"));

 

setTimeout(() => console.log(document.body.innerHTML));

Consider the following code:

const fs = require('fs');

const util = require('util');

const readFile = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

 

async function readTwoFiles(newYorkWeatherFile, londonWeatherFile) {

  const options = { encoding: 'utf-8' };

  const nyWeather = await readFile(newYorkWeatherFile, options);

  const londonWeather = await readFile(londonWeatherFile, options);

  return [nyWeather, londonWeather];

};

 

let result = readTwoFiles('weatherFileNewYork', 'weatherFileLondon');

Select all the statements that are correct about readTwoFiles function.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) The files are read using asynchronous calls.

2) The file read operations are blocking the event-loop.

3) It does not require the async keyword.

4) Variable result is a Promise.

5) Since the nyWeather and londonWeather variables are assigned the result of the await statement, they will both be Promises.

6) Files will be read one by one.

The following code models a shopping cart that shows an alert to the user when the last item is removed:

const events = require("events");

const emitter = new events.EventEmitter();

let itemQuantities = [];

 

const cartUpdateHandler = function(itemId, change){

  if(itemQuantities[itemId] === undefined){

    itemQuantities[itemId] = 0;

  }

  if(change + itemQuantities[itemId] >= 0) {

    itemQuantities[itemId] += change;

  }

}

 

const checkHandler = function(){

  if(itemQuantities.every(quantity => quantity == 0))

    showAlert("cart empty");

}

 

emitter.on("cart_updated", cartUpdateHandler);

emitter.on("check_cart", checkHandler);

 

function addToCart(itemId, qty){

  //called each time user adds item to cart

  emitter.emit("cart_updated", itemId, qty);

}

 
function removeFromCart(itemId, qty){

  //called each time user removes item from cart

  emitter.emit("cart_updated", itemId, -1 * qty);

  emitter.emit("check_cart");

}

Select all the true statements.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) itemQuantites will not contain any negative number.

2) This code will also show an alert correctly if the "check_cart" event is emitted at the end of the cartUpdateHandler function instead of the removeFromCart function.

3) Emitting the "cart_updated" event is not required in the removeFromCart function.

4) The "check_cart" event should also be emitted at the end of the addToCart function.

A project folder contains two files that are listed below. Fill in the blanks in these two files so that, when main.js is invoked with a temperature in Fahrenheit, the same temperature in Celsius is appended to log.txt.


utility.js:

___________________.toCelsius = (fahrenheit) => { 
  return (fahrenheit-32) * 5/9; 
}
main.js:
 

const fs = require('fs');
const utility = require('___________________');

fs.appendFile('log.txt',___________________(process.argv[2]) + "\n",
(err) => { if (err) throw err; });


For example, when "node main.js 68" is executed, "20" should be appended to the log.txt.

Following are frequently asked React interview questions for fresher‚Äôs as well as 
experienced React developers.
1) What is Reactjs?
React is a JavaScript library that makes building user interfaces easy. It was developed 
by Facebook.
2) Does React use HTML?
No, It uses JSX, which is similar to HTML.
3) When was React first released?
React was first released on March 2013.
4) Give me two most significant drawbacks of React
ÔÇ∑ Integrating React with the MVC framework like Rails requires complex 
configuration. 
ÔÇ∑ React require the users to have knowledge about the integration of user interface 
into MVC framework.
5) State the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM
Real DOM Virtual DOM
It is updated slowly. It updates faster.
It allows a direct update from HTML. It cannot be used to update HTML 
directly.
It wastes too much memory. Memory consumption is less
6) What is Flux Concept In React?
Facebook widely uses flux architecture concept for developing client-side web 
applications. It is not a framework or a library. It is simply a new kind of architecture 
that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow.
3 | P a g e
7) Define the term Redux in React
Redux is a library used for front end development. It is a state container for JavaScript 
applications which should be used for the applications state management. You can test 
and run an application developed with Redux in different environments.
8) What is the 'Store' feature in Redux?
Redux has a feature called 'Store' which allows you to save the application's entire State 
at one place. Therefore all it's component's State are stored in the Store so that you will 
get regular updates directly from the Store. The single state tree helps you to keep track 
of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
9) What is an action in Redux?
It is a function which returns an action object. The action-type and the action data are 
always stored in the action object. Actions can send data between the Store and the 
software application. All information retrieved by the Store is produced by the actions.
10) Name the important features of React 
Here, are important features of React.
Allows you to use 3rd party libraries
Time-Saving
Faster Development
Simplicity and Composable 
Fully supported by 
Facebook.
Code Stability with One-directional data binding 
React Components
11) Explain the term stateless components
Stateless components are pure functions that render DOM-based solely on the 
properties provided to them.
12) Explain React Router
React Router is a routing library which allows you to add new screen flows to your 
application, and it also keeps URL in sync with what‚Äôs being shown on the page.
4 | P a g e
13) What is dispatcher?
A dispatcher is a central hub of app where you will receive actions and broadcast 
payload to registered callbacks.
14) What is meant by callback function? What is its purpose?
A callback function should be called when setState has finished, and the component is 
retendered. As the setState is asynchronous, which is why it takes in a second callback 
function.
15) Explain the term high order component
A higher-order component also shortly known as HOC is an advanced technique for 
reusing component logic. It is not a part of the React API, but they are a pattern which 
emerges from React‚Äôs compositional nature.
16) Explain the Presentational segment
A presentational part is a segment which allows you to renders HTML. The segment‚Äôs 
capacity is presentational in markup.
17) What are Props in react js?
Props mean properties, which is a way of passing data from parent to child. We can say 
that props are just a communication channel between components. It is always moving 
from parent to child component.
18) Explain yield catchphrase in JavaScript
The yield catchphrase is utilized to delay and resume a generator work, which is known 
as yield catchphrase.
19) Name two types of React component 
Two types of react Components are:
Function component
Class component
5 | P a g e
20) Explain synthetic event in React js
Synthetic event is a kind of object which acts as a cross-browser wrapper around the 
browser‚Äôs native event. It also helps us to combine the behaviors of various browser into 
signal API.
21) What is React State?
It is an object which decides how a specific component renders and how it behaves. The 
state stores the information which can be changed over the lifetime of a React 
component.
22) How can you update state in react js?
A state can be updated on the component directly or indirectly.
23) Explain the use of the arrow function in React
The arrow function helps you to predict the behavior of bugs when passed as a callback. 
Therefore, it prevents bug caused by this all together.
24) State the main difference between Pros and State 
The main difference the two is that the State is mutable and Pros are immutable.
25) Explain pure components in React js
Pure components are the fastest components which can replace any component with 
only a render(). It helps you to enhance the simplicity of the code and performance of the 
application.
26) What kind of information controls a segment in React?
There are mainly two sorts of information that control a segment: State and Props
State: State information that will change, we need to utilize State.
 Props: Props are set by the parent and which are settled all through the lifetime 
of a part.
27) What is 'create-react-app'? 
'create-react-app' is a command-line tool which allows you to create one basic react 
application.
6 | P a g e
28) Explain the use of 'key' in react list
Keys allow you to provide each list element with a stable identity. The keys should be 
unique.
29) What are children prop?
Children props are used to pass component to other components as properties. 
30) Explain error boundaries?
Error boundaries help you to catch Javascript error anywhere in the child components. 
They are most used to log the error and show a fallback UI.
31) What is the use of empty tags ?
Empty tags are used in React for declaring fragments.
32) Explain strict mode
StrictMode allows you to run checks and warnings for react components. It runs only on 
development build. It helps you to highlight the issues without rendering any visible UI.
33) What are reacted portals?
Portal allows you to render children into a DOM node. CreatePortalmethod is used for 
it.
34) What is Context?
React context helps you to pass data using the tree of react components. It helps you to 
share data globally between various react components.
35) What is the use of Webpack?
Webpack in basically is a module builder. It is mainly runs during the development 
process.
36) What is Babel in React js?
Babel, is a JavaScript compiler that converts latest JavaScript like ES6, ES7 into plain 
old ES5 JavaScript that most browsers understand.
7 | P a g e
37) How can a browser read JSX file?
If you want the browser to read JSX, then that JSX file should be replaced using a JSX 
transformer like Babel and then send back to the browser.
38) What are the major issues of using MVC architecture in React?
Here are the major challenges you will face while handling MVC architecture:
ÔÇ∑ DOM handling is quite expensive
ÔÇ∑ Most of the time applications were slow and inefficient
ÔÇ∑ Because of circular functions, a complex model has been created around 
models and ideas
39) What can be done when there is more than one line of expression?
At that time a multi-line JSX expression is the only option left for you.
40) What is the reduction?
The reduction is an application method of handling State.
41) Explain the term synthetic events
It is actually a cross-browser wrapper around the browser‚Äôs native event. These events 
have interface stopPropagation() and preventDefault().
42) When should you use the top-class elements for the function element? 
If your element does a stage or lifetime cycle, we should use top-class elements.
43) How can you share an element in the parsing?
Using the State, we can share the data.
44) Explain the term reconciliation
When a component's state or props change then rest will compare the rendered element 
with previously rendered DOM and will update the actual DOM if it is needed. This 
process is known as reconciliation.
8 | P a g e
45) How can you re-render a component without using setState() function?
You can use forceUpdate() function for re-rending any component.
46) Can you update props in react?
You can‚Äôt update props in react js because props are read-only. Moreover, you can not 
modify props received from parent to child.
47) Explain the term 'Restructuring.'
Restructuring is extraction process of array objects. Once the process is completed, you 
can separate each object in a separate variable.
48) Can you update the values of props?
It is not possible to update the value of props as it is immutable.
49) Explain the meaning of Mounting and Demounting
ÔÇ∑ The process of attaching the element to the DCOM is called mounting.
ÔÇ∑ The process of detaching the element from the DCOM is called the demounting 
process.
50) What is the use of ‚Äòprops-types‚Äô liberary?
'Prop-types' library allows you to perform runtime type checking for props and similar 
object in a recent application.
