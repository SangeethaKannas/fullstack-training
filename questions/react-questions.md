 Q1: What are React hooks? Explain the difference between useState and useEffect.

A1: React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. useState is used to manage state, while useEffect is used to handle side effects like fetching data or subscribing to events.

üí° Code Example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
 document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);

üß© Q2: What is the Context API in React? How can it be used to manage global state?

A2: Context API provides a way to share data between components without passing it through props. It's useful for managing global state. You create a context using createContext and provide it at a higher level. Consumers can access the context using useContext.

üåç Code Example:
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
 return (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
   <Component />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
 );
}

function Component() {
 const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
 // Use theme value here
}

‚öõÔ∏è Q3: What are React render props? How do they enable component composition and code reusability?

A3: Render props is a pattern where a component accepts a function as a prop and calls it to render content. It enables component composition and code reusability by allowing components to share their internal state or behavior with other components.

üîÑ Code Example:
function MouseTracker({ render }) {
 const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

 useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
   setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  };

  window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);

  return () => {
   window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
  };
 }, []);

 return render(position);
}

üñ•Ô∏è Q4: How can you optimize performance in a React application? Discuss techniques like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading.

A4: Performance optimization techniques include memoization with useMemo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary recalculations, code splitting to split the bundle into smaller chunks, and lazy loading to load components or resources only when needed.

‚ö°Ô∏è Code Example:
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
 // Handle click event
}, []);
