Q1: What are React hooks? Explain the difference between useState and useEffect.

A1: React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.useState is used to manage state, while useEffect is used to handle side effects like fetching data or subscribing to events.

üí° Code Example:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
 document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);

üß© Q2: What is the Context API in React? How can it be used to manage global state?

A2: Context API provides a way to share data between components without passing it through props.It's useful for managing global state.You create a context using createContext and provide it at a higher level.Consumers can access the context using useContext.

üåç Code Example:
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
 return (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
   <Component />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
 );
}

function Component() {
 const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
 // Use theme value here
}

‚öõÔ∏è Q3: What are React render props? How do they enable component composition and code reusability?

A3: Render props is a pattern where a component accepts a function as a prop and calls it to render content.It enables component composition and code reusability by allowing components to share their internal state or behavior with other components.

üîÑ Code Example:
function MouseTracker({ render }) {
 const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

 useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
   setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  };

  window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);

  return () => {
   window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
  };
 }, []);

 return render(position);
}

üñ•Ô∏è Q4: How can you optimize performance in a React application? Discuss techniques like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading.

A4: Performance optimization techniques include memoization with useMemo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary recalculations, code splitting to split the bundle into smaller chunks, and lazy loading to load components or resources only when needed.

‚ö°Ô∏è Code Example:
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
 // Handle click event
}, []);

    A web store uses the following React component for showing suggestions while users are typing product names:

const ProductSearch = (props) => {

  let [name, setName] = React.useState();

  let [suggestions, setSuggestions] = React.useState([]);


  React.useEffect(() => {

    if(name !== undefined) {

      props.requestSuggestions(name, setSuggestions);

    }

  }, [name]);

 

  const onChange = (event) => {

    setName(event.target.value);

  };


  return (

    <div>

      <label htmlFor={"search"}>Product name</label>

      <input onChange={onChange} id={"search"} list={"suggestions"}></input>

      <datalist id={"suggestions"}>

        { suggestions.map((suggestion) => <option>{ suggestion }</option>) }

      </datalist>

    </div>

  );

};

Select all the correct answers.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) If the props.requestSuggestions function invokes setSuggestions using [name, suggestions] as the second parameter of React.useEffect, the component will be rerendered after each React.useEffect call.

2) On the first component render, the value of the suggestions variable will be [].

3) If the requestSuggestions function is async and does not call the setSuggestion function immediately, it will throw an error.

4) The function passed to React.useEffect should call ReactDOM.render so that changes to the suggestions variable are visible.

5) If the requestSuggestions function calls setSuggestions with two items, they will be shown in the datalist.

6) Calling setName("10") will make the input field have 10 as its value.

The following React component is used as a login form for a website:

function LoginForm(props) {

  let [username, setUsername] = React.useState("");

  let [password, setPassword] = React.useState(null);


  return (<div>

    <input onChange={(event) => setUsername(event.target.value)} name="username"></input>

    <input onChange={(event) => setPassword(event.target.value)} name="password" type="password"></input>

    <button onClick={() => props.login(username, password)}>Login</button>

  </div>);

}

Select all the true statements.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) When the component is first created, the username variable‚Äôs value will be null.

2) Pasting into the input field named "password" will change the value of the password variable to the value of the input field.

3) The call to props.login will always be made with "" as the username and null as the password.

4) LoginForm is a functional component.

5) If the setUsername function and all its references are renamed, calling it will not change the username variable.

6) The parent component should pass a prop function named login to handle the click event on the "Login" button.

















Consider the following React component which is used to validate emails in forms:
class EmailInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { inputValue: '', isValid: false };
  }

  render() {
    let onChange = (event) => {
      this.setState({inputValue: event.target.value}); 
      if(event.target.value.includes("@")) {
        this.setState({isValid: true});
      } else {
        this.setState({isValid: false});
      }
    };

    return <div><input onChange={onChange} /><p>{ this.state.isValid ? '' : this.props.message }</p></div>
  }
}
A new component, Form, was recently added to the app. Form will always be a parent component to EmailInput and make decisions based on data from it.
Select the minimal changes so that the state is lifted up from EmailInput to the Form component.
(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) The inputValue state should be kept in the Form component and passed as a prop to the EmailInput component.
2) The Form component should pass a callback as a prop to update the state of isValid and inputValue.
3) The onChange event handler should invoke the callback passed from the Form component to update the values.
4) The render function should be passed as a prop from Form to the EmailInput component.
5) The message props should be changed from props to state inside the EmailInput components.
6) The conditional in JSX should be replaced by this.parent.state.isValid.

If you are using the following component for various buttons that can only be clicked once:

class ClickOnceButton extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

    this.state = { wasClicked: false };

  }


  onButtonClick(event) {

    if(!this.state.wasClicked) {

      this.props.onClick(event);

    }

    this.setState({ wasClicked: true });

  }


  render() {

    return (<button onClick={ ____________ }>{ this.props.text }</button>);

  }

}

Select all the answers that fill the blank in onClick so that it correctly calls the onButtonClick method. 

(Select all acceptable answers.)

1) this.onButtonClick.bind(this)

2) this.onButtonClick

3) (event) => this.onButtonClick(event)

4) (event) => this.onButtonClick.bind(event)

5) this.onButtonClick(event)

Finish the SubscribeButton component so that it renders the following HTML:

<button>Click to subscribe!</button>

After the button is clicked, it should no longer be visible and should render the following:

<p>Thank you for subscribing!</p>

The component should use React Hooks.

HTML5, CSS3, React v18 (available as React and ReactDOM)

 

// React is loaded and is available as React and ReactDOM

// imports should NOT be used

const SubscribeButton = (props) => {

  const [isClicked, setIsClicked] = React.useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => {  setIsClicked(true); }

  return { isClicked ? <button onClick={handleClick} >Click to subscribe!</button>
		      :  <p>Thank you for subscribing!</p>
 };

};

document.body.innerHTML = "<div id='root' />";

ReactDOM.render(<SubscribeButton />, document.getElementById("root"));

 

setTimeout(() => console.log(document.body.innerHTML));

A team has created the following package.json for their new Node.js web application:

{

  "name": "webapp",

  "version": "1.0.0",

  "description": "",

  "main": "index_main.js",

  "scripts": {

    "test": "echo \"Error\" && exit 1"

  },

  "author": "",

  "license": "ISC",

  "dependencies": {

    "express": "^4.17.1",

    "random": "~2.1.8"

  }

}

What can be concluded about the project, considering only the package.json declaration?

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) The project could use the 4.18.1 version of the express dependency.

2) The project could use the 4.17.2 version of the express dependency.

3) The project could use the 2.1.9 version of the random dependency.

4) The project could use the 2.2.0 version of the random dependency.

Consider the following code:

const fs = require('fs');

const util = require('util');

const readFile = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

 

async function readTwoFiles(newYorkWeatherFile, londonWeatherFile) {

  const options = { encoding: 'utf-8' };

  const nyWeather = await readFile(newYorkWeatherFile, options);

  const londonWeather = await readFile(londonWeatherFile, options);

  return [nyWeather, londonWeather];

};

 

let result = readTwoFiles('weatherFileNewYork', 'weatherFileLondon');

Select all the statements that are correct about readTwoFiles function.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) The files are read using asynchronous calls.

2) The file read operations are blocking the event-loop.

3) It does not require the async keyword.

4) Variable result is a Promise.

5) Since the nyWeather and londonWeather variables are assigned the result of the await statement, they will both be Promises.

6) Files will be read one by one.

The following code models a shopping cart that shows an alert to the user when the last item is removed:

const events = require("events");

const emitter = new events.EventEmitter();

let itemQuantities = [];

 

const cartUpdateHandler = function(itemId, change){

  if(itemQuantities[itemId] === undefined){

    itemQuantities[itemId] = 0;

  }

  if(change + itemQuantities[itemId] >= 0) {

    itemQuantities[itemId] += change;

  }

}

 

const checkHandler = function(){

  if(itemQuantities.every(quantity => quantity == 0))

    showAlert("cart empty");

}

 

emitter.on("cart_updated", cartUpdateHandler);

emitter.on("check_cart", checkHandler);

 

function addToCart(itemId, qty){

  //called each time user adds item to cart

  emitter.emit("cart_updated", itemId, qty);

}

 
function removeFromCart(itemId, qty){

  //called each time user removes item from cart

  emitter.emit("cart_updated", itemId, -1 * qty);

  emitter.emit("check_cart");

}

Select all the true statements.

(Select all acceptable answers.)

 

1) itemQuantites will not contain any negative number.

2) This code will also show an alert correctly if the "check_cart" event is emitted at the end of the cartUpdateHandler function instead of the removeFromCart function.

3) Emitting the "cart_updated" event is not required in the removeFromCart function.

4) The "check_cart" event should also be emitted at the end of the addToCart function.

A project folder contains two files that are listed below. Fill in the blanks in these two files so that, when main.js is invoked with a temperature in Fahrenheit, the same temperature in Celsius is appended to log.txt.


utility.js:

___________________.toCelsius = (fahrenheit) => { 
  return (fahrenheit-32) * 5/9; 
}
main.js:
 

const fs = require('fs');
const utility = require('___________________');

fs.appendFile('log.txt',___________________(process.argv[2]) + "\n",
(err) => { if (err) throw err; });


For example, when "node main.js 68" is executed, "20" should be appended to the log.txt.
