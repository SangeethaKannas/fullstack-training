Modules

CommonJS standards
   require - module
   
   eg
     
    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
        res.end('Hello World!');
    }).listen(8080);
    
    var http = require('http');

var app = http.createServer(function(req,res){
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    res.send(JSON.stringify({ a: 1 }, null, 3));
});
app.listen(3000);

#Event Driven

The difference between an event and a callback function is that callback functions are executed when an asynchronous function returns some result. In contrast, events follow the observer pattern in which the function that listens for an event is called an Observer. When an event is fired, the observer/listener function gets executed.

Methods of the EventEmitter clas

addListener(event, listener)  removeListener(event, listener)  remoeAllListeners({event})   listeners(event)

on(event, listener)

once(event, listener) - handle event only once

emit(event , [arg1, ar2...])

EventEmitter.listenerCount(emitter, event)

Events
  newListener
  removeListener
  error
 
Passing arguments and this (refers to EventEmmitter) to event listeners

listenrs cfalled synchronously
   setImmediate() or process.nextTick()
   
 Handling error events - prevents node termination

    The advantage of using events rather than normal callbacks is that a different reaction can be given to the same signal several times with the help of multiple listeners. In contrast, if callbacks are used for this purpose, more logic needs to be written within a single callback. Events allow multiple actions to be taken based on state change and provide a different functionality each time an event occurs. 
 
 patterns commonly used in Node.js to raise and bind events using EventEmitter are as follows: 
Return EventEmitter from a function 
Extend the EventEmitter class


Design patterns

1. Multiple listeners
2. Using event emitter properties
3. Publisher subscriber scenario
4. Events of built-in modules
5. 


 Symbols are used as an alternative to Strings while setting keys for properties. Symbols are used for hiding properties on Objects. This is because the values can be accessed only by using the same instance of the Symbol. To access a property using Symbol key, use the notation object[symbol] as shown in below example.
