Asynchronous functions do not return meaningful values: we give them a callback so that the result of the async operation can be communicated back to us.

What are the life cycle methods; how are them used with hooks? Shortlyyy ...

React is made from components. It behaves in a dual way. That means: a component may be rendered because “something” happened to it. And a component may trigger a render because it does “something”, like for example setting state.

The life cycle methods are the “tools” which manage that “something”.

By ex:

A component is rendered and it may show “something” pulled from back-end. Then is when componentDidMount happens. It is translated to useEffect hook with an empty array of dependency (useEffect fires when first the component is rendered).

A component may update because there is new data coming in from somewhere (back-end or another component). Then is when componentDidUpdate happens. It is the same useEffect as in case here up, with the difference that now the array of dependency is filled with the variable (props) on which it needs to be triggered.

When a component unmount, there may be side effects left inside it. By ex a asynchronous operation going on which has not finished yet. The component need to be unmounted with componentWillUnmount. This is achieved with useEffect hook which returns a cleanup function where it is told that the asynchronous operation is over.

1. It's just a View library
2. Keep your components Small
3. Write functional component
4. Write stateless components
5. Use Redux.js
6. Always use prop Types
7. Use JSX, ES6
8. Use React and Redux Developer tools
