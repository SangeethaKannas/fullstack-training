### UI Design Patterns

### Navigation Tabs
Problem summary
Content needs to be separated into sections and accessed using a flat navigation structure that gives a clear indication of current location.
Usage
Use when there are between 2 – 9 sections of content that need a flat navigation mode.
Use when section names are relatively short
Use when you want the navigation to fill the entire width of a page
Use when you want to provide a list of the highest available sections/subsections of the website
Do not use when wanting to show content-specific data. For instance for showing latest articles
Do not use when there is no need to single-out the currently selected option
Do not use when the list of sections or categories call for a “more…” link. Then consider another navigation pattern


### S
Problem summary
User needs to navigate among a website's main sections while still being able to quickly browse to the subsection of another.
Use when you want the benefits of a normal sidebar menu, but do not have the space to list all options.
Use when there are more than 2 main sections on a website each with 2 or more subsections.
Use when you have less than 10 main sections
Use when you only have two levels to show in the main navigation

### Input
The user needs to quickly enter data into the system, which then in turn interprets the user's input.
Usage
Use when the more explicit select boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes make entering data a too complicated process for the user to engage with the system.
Use when the time it takes to complete a task proportional exceeds the importance of the goal the user wants to accomplish.
Use when the input you want to collect is relates to one topic. For instance a physical location or an event with a given start time.
Use when the expected user input can be somewhat easily interpreted by a computer program.
Do not use when the user can possibly ask or input anything. Only use for a narrowly defined purpose.

###  Pervasive Design Patterns

Problem summary
We tend to accept the default option instead of comparing the actual benefit to the actual cost
Usage
Use when you want the user to choose the default option you want them to
Use when you are making changes to your offering and want to keep users as your customers.
Solution
Frame the option you would like your user to choose as the default option and make the cognitive load to understand alternative options too big to comprehend at a glance.
When the user has a number of options to choose from, you can help him or her on the way by framing one of the options as the default option.
When the user has a number of options to choose from, you can help him or her on the way by framing one of the options as the default option. Letâ€™s say you run a subscription based web application with several plans, each with its own price and list of benefits. A popular plan is going to be dropped in favor of one with a higher price and better list of benefits, which leaves the users to either downgrade or upgrade; loosing old features or gaining new. Moving everybody to the new plan and framing it as being the same with new features positions the status quo reference point to the bigger plan, with the result that most people will “stay”.
Facebook utilized the status-quo bias in December 2009, when they changed their user privacy policy. They changed a user’s privacy settings into having a default setting which the user had to opt-out from. The complicated and non-transparent nature of the new policy kept users from changing them.
Rationale
As making decisions grows increasingly more complex, we have a harder time using our emotional heuristics to shortcut decision making to approximate rational thinking. Instead we tend to accept the default option instead of comparing the actual benefit [gain] to the actual cost [loss]1.
Discussion
Once we have acquired a gain, we change the way we evaluate what has been acquired as our reference point is now new. This is the root of the status quo bias. If the status quo serves as a reference point, the features you loose might be valued more when they are given up than when they were being acquired3.
Adding to the status quo bias is that surprising fact that people tend to still accept the easiest way out even when the decision is important and the stakes are large â€“ and even when they are told the default decision is not optimal1.
More choice is not always better. Complexity delays choice, further increasing the fraction of consumers, who will adopt the default options 2.
Lots of choices will grab our attention, but too many will overwhelm us to the point where we likely won’t choose (or buy) at all 4.

### Bread Crumbs

The user needs to know their location in the website's hierarchical structure in order to possibly browse back to a higher level in the hierarchy.
Usage
Use when the structure of the website follows a strict hierarchical structure of similar formatted content.
Use when the structure of the site is partitioned in to sections which can be divided into more subsections and so on.
Use when the user is most likely to have landed on the page from an external source (another site deep linking to the web page in question). For instance from a blog or a search engine.
Use when the page in question is placed fairly deep into the hierarchy of pages and when no other form of visual navigation can show the details of the same deep level.
Use together with some sort of main navigation.
Do not use on the topmost level of the hierarchy (typically the welcome page)
Do not use alone as the main navigation of the website.


### Simple

Home link - Use when users frequently enter the website through a page other than the home page. The user needs to be able to easily navigate to the starting point or front page of the website
Fat Footer
Use to shortcut an otherwise hierarchical structure of a website.
Use when there are specific pages or functions that are more frequently used than others parts of the website. Use the shortcut box to show these choices in order to shorten the path for the users.
Use when you want shortcuts to pages that are possibly on different hierarchical levels of the page.
Can also be used as navigation when short on space, although it is not advised.
