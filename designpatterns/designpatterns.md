Factory
 Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate

Observer
    Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state

Singleton
    Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it

Builder
    Builds complex objects with flexible representation options.

Adapter
    Enables classes with incompatible interraces to work together by converting one interface into another

Decorator
    Dynamically adds new behavior to an object at runtime by wrapping it in an object of a decorator class.

Proxy
    Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another objecgt to control access to it.

Strategy
    Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms for flexible use based on client requirements.

Command
    Encapsulates a request as an object thereby letting you parametrize clients with queues, requests and operations

Template
    Defines algorithm structure in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specificsteps whiel preserving overall structure

Iterator
    Sequentially accesses elements of an aggregate objecgt while hiding its underlying representation

State
    Dynamic behaviour change based on internal state, giving object the apperance of changing its class.
