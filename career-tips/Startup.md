if you're ramping up on a B2B product, here are some critical artifacts you'll need to consume (or create) as you're onboarding customer journey map - the repeatable playbook for how an account lands / expands and the GTM + product milestones on that path customer maturity model - a bucketing of the account base along clear lines of “readiness” for different parts of the product portfolio product portfolio overview - breakdown of the core product, key add-ons, and complementary modules along with canonical use cases for each use case matrix - all the recurring usage patterns for the product, potentially broken down by industry / department verticals key differentiators - structural, foundational product investments that cannot be easily copied by the competition in a reasonable timeframe customer health model - usually a RED / YELLOW / GREEN categorization based on certain usage levers / adoption milestones north star primer - what key metric the product org is focused on, how it’s calculated, what the drivers are, and how it ladders up to customer value user adoption lifecycle - what are the key aha! moments for things to click lost report - what are the recurring reasons we lose deals that came in as qualified leads? professional services playbook - what steps do implementation consultants take to get a customer onboarded onto product (usually 30/60/90 view) personas in play - who are the key players in the purchase, implementation, adoption, expansion, and renewal cycles (users / consumers / influencers) company loop / product flywheel - a synthesis of the core motion (across product development and go-to-market) that powers customer value / runs the business

Startup Tips and Tricks
What do we learn from the recent advice letter from "YC"?

In a nutshell, YC is saying about the "current worst economic downfall.

1. Global economics are taking a U-turn reversal after long 13 years bull run.
2. Due to a peak Economic downturn, Be dead or alive for the next two years.
3. Things don't look as good as in earlier years.
4. Cut costs and plan for survival mode.
5. It's the founder's responsibility to ensure your startup should survive even if you can't raise any more rounds of money for the next two years.
6. VCs will have a hard time raising money from prospective groups.
7. Stop high burn and stay on long-run revenues.
8. For early-stage founders, Don't be fooled into thinking raising funding this time is as easy as previous.
9. For the founders who are running startups, Future fundraising is much more difficult than before.
10. Chances of getting funded will be extremely low even if your startup doing great, Recommend you to change your plans.

My observation:
I don't think these will apply only to Economic downfall, As a founder of a company, we should know when to sell, where to sell, and how to sell, then focus on our expansion more calmly and maintain the stability by not layoff employees.
There are a lot of companies thinking to lay off further and further, whereas, at the same time, there are companies who are looking for great talent by ready to offer high-paid premium packages.

When we have money in our company account, If we don't have long-lasting financial planning, focusing on user acquisition rather than retention is a worse strategy.

* Cash flows are king.
* Slow growth is sometimes good
* Low burn, High retention
* Great customer experience
* Maintain great relations
* Innovation required in product development
* Recognize existing talent then look for new talent.
* Show Empathy and Good care to employees
* The hybrid work model rather blindly says "come back to the office"
* Try talking to employees about why they hesitate to come back to Tier 1 cities rather than prefer to stay in Tier 2 & 3.
* Understand what your customer's needs, rather than wants.
* Plan your financial forecastings wisely.

As a founder, Reduce your stress & find time to be happy. because that's all it matters to your body & soul.
