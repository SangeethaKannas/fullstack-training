In a world that often measures success by the weight of one's wallet, it's crucial to remind ourselves that happiness is not a product on a shelf, but a state of mind.

While financial stability is essential, equating it to lasting happiness is an oversimplification. Real happiness comes from inside us and is more important than having lots of money.

Let's delve into how we can nurture happiness, irrespective of the balance in our bank accounts.

👉𝗡𝘂𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀: Cultivate meaningful connections with friends and family. Love and support are priceless treasures.

👉𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗲: Focus on what you have rather than what you lack. A grateful heart can find contentment in the simplest of things.

👉𝗔𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Helping others not only benefits them but also brings a sense of purpose and joy to your own life.

👉𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵: Continuous learning and self-improvement contribute to a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.

👉𝗘𝗻𝗷𝗼𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Mindfulness and being fully present in what you're doing can bring immense joy, even in difficult times.

Happiness is an inside job, and it's within our reach to unlock it.

1. If we are dealing with a read-heavy system, it's good to consider using a Cache.

2. If we need low latency in the system, it's good to consider using a Cache & CDN.

3. If we are dealing with a write-heavy system, it's good to use a Message Queue for Async processing

4. If we need a system to be ACID complaint, we should go for RDBMS or SQL Database

5. If data is unstructured & doesn't require ACID properties, we should go for NO-SQL Database

6. If the system has complex data in the form of videos, images, files etc, we should go for Blob/Object storage

7. If the system requires complex pre-computation like a news feed, we should use a Message Queue & Cache

8. If the system requires searching data in high volume, we should consider using a search index, tries or a search engine like Elasticsearch

9. If the system requires to Scale SQL Database, we should consider using Database Sharding

10. If the system requires High Availability, Performance, & Throughput, we should consider using a Load Balancer

11. If the system requires faster data delivery globally, reliability, high availability, & performance, we should consider using a CDN

12. If the system has data with nodes, edges, and relationships like friend lists, & road connections, we should consider using a Graph Database

13. If the system needs scaling of various components like servers, databases, etc, we should consider using Horizontal Scaling

14. If the system requires high-performing database queries, we should use Database Indexes

15. If the system requires bulk job processing, we should consider using Batch Processing & Message Queues

16. If the system requires reducing server load and preventing DOS attacks, we should use a Rate Limiter

17. If the system has microservices, we should consider using an API Gateway (Authentication, SSL Termination, Routing etc)

18. If the system has a single point of failure, we should implement Redundancy in that component

19. If the system needs to be fault-tolerant, & durable, we should implement Data Replication (creating multiple copies of data on different servers)

20. If the system needs user-to-user communication (bi-directional) in a fast way, we should use Websockets
