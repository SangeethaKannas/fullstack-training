# Facebook interview 
Interview Process
----
Here is what to expect in a Facebook interview for software engineers:
  
◈ Recruiter Pre-screen (20-30 mins) - Initial screening based on resume. Questions related to your professional experience, noteworthy projects, and accomplishments. No coding.
 
◈ Technical Phone Interview (45-60 mins) – You will solve a coding question using an online editor. Your interviewer might ask you a follow-up question or add constraints to the current problem. Common topics include data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexity.  
 
◈ Onsite Loop (4-5 interviews) - Coding, design, and behavioral questions.
 ➡ Ninja (coding, 2 interviews) – 1-2 coding questions solved on a whiteboard in 45 mins.
 ➡ Pirate (design, 2 interviews) – Collaborative discussion with the interviewer. Drawing on a whiteboard to solve a system design question. Junior engineers don't get any design interviews.
 ➡ Jedi (behavioral) Questions about your motivation, people interactions, challenges, and work ethics. 
 
◈ Lunch - It's not an interview. The interviewer will show you around and have lunch with you.
 
Interview Tips
----
  
1) Data Structures - Practice data structures like Heaps, HashTable, Tree, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and Graph. 
2) Algorithm - Practice recursion, Merge-Sort, Quick-Sort, Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Divide and Conquer, and Dynamic Programming
3) Explain your thought process - Extremely important. Practice describing your solution and design decisions clearly and concisely.
4) Collaborate – Don't forget to discuss, present multiple solutions, and take hints from the interviewer.

### Interview Rounds

Round 1: Few companies have first written round, comprising of MCQs on core Data Engineering topics like Spark, Hadoop, AWS/Azure/GCP, SQL, Hive, etc. along with a few coding questions.

Round 2: Primarily based on SQL. It included questions around-
• All types of Joins  
• Group By
• Indexing
• CASE-WHEN statement 
• Null-Safe Join
• CTE(Common Table Expressions)
• Dealing with duplicates
• Any, All, and exists
• Union operation, Subqueries, Having clause
• Windowing Functions like Rank (), Row_Number() & Dense_Rank()
• Over Clause with Partition and OrderBy
• Aggregation on windowing functions like SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() etc.

DSA is also one of the necessary skillsets for a Data Engineer. Can expect questions from basic/intermediate level on topics such as Array, String, Stack, Queue, Linked List, and Tree.

Round 3: Coding question on Python with a primary focus on Pandas and Data Structures such as List, Tuple, Set & Dictionary. Another important domain is Spark, with questions on-
• How Distributed computing works
• Spark Architecture
• MapReduce Vs Spark
• Catalyst Optimizer
• How driver works in cluster mode 
• RDD
• Lazy Evaluation
• Fault Tolerance in Spark
• Lineage Graph 
• Groupbykey and Reduceby key
• Persistence and Caching 
• Optimization in Spark
• How to tune a spark job
• Repartition and Coalesce
• Partitioning and Bucketing
• Narrow and Wide transformations

Round 4: Based on any cloud platform you are most familiar with. It included questions around-
• ETL and ELT architecture
• Schedule spark jobs using Databricks
• Azure Data Factory
• Integration runtime and linked Service
• Azure Data Lake
• SDLC
• Agile methodology 
• DevOps Strategy 
• CI/CD pipeline
• Git
• Database concepts
• Configuration of spark cluster in terms of executor memory, number of worker nodes, executors per worker nodes, cores per executor & driver memory.
• Working & internal lakehouse architecture of Databricks
• Batch processing & stream processing using Spark
• Big Data File Formats, Delta tables

These rounds were focused on data modeling, PySpark & ETL pipeline design.

Round 5(Hiring Manager Round): It comprised of low- and high-level system design questions like-
• Components
• Data warehouse structure
• Movement of data
• Tools you would use for Extraction, Transformation, and Loading of the data
• How to optimize the design with given constraints

Also, it had a High-level project discussion based on resume and previous work experience, tech stack used, challenges faced, How you solved those, What was your role in previous teams, etc.

### Interview Strategy

1. Confidence is the key. Don’t jump into the interview process when you are not fully prepared. 

2. Rather than doing 1000s of leetcode (https://lnkd.in/gyRnXuHQ), do few examples and understand the patterns which will help you to crack any problem. Also, think about all edge cases and test cases. 

3. At the end, spend some time thinking about time and space complexity. It gets tricky with graph and tree problems.

4. Think about the possible use cases of the given problem, for example, flood fill is nothing but the paint app and try to explain that to the interviewer. 

5. Create a Google doc and list down all recent/interesting project you worked on. Start with design, implementation, testing, monitoring, your contribution and ask yourself what questions a person can ask if he/she doesn’t have any idea about the project. This will also help you during the system design interview.

6. Also, create a Google doc for behavior questions (https://lnkd.in/gPp8iE_x) and write down what was the situation, what was your task, what action you took and what was the result. Read more about the STAR approach. Companies like Amazon, pays more attention to these questions so be well-prepared.  

7. Do practice interviews with your friends and peers, and take feedback seriously. 

8. At the end of an onsite interview, make a list of what went well and where you need to put more attention and work on it.  

9. While practicing system design, try to relate things with your current or past experience. Like how server side configuration has been set up or how APIs are implemented in your current project. This way you will remember things easily.    

10. Before your onsite interview, visit Glassdoor (https://lnkd.in/gwKXeYQA) and read about other’s experiences. That will give you an idea on what to expect. 

11. Lastly, don’t get dejected by rejections. Sometimes it looks difficult, but with enough practice and hard work, you will get your dream job.


### FAANG Rounds

# FAANG Interview road map
Learn DSA - Search Abdul Bari and GFG

System Design - Nobody can come close to Alex Xu. Follow him religiously. Also you can take a look at Grokking

Round 1 (Basic JS Round):

🤝 Started with introductions and discussed my work experience.
💻 Technical questions covered Promises, asynchronous behavior, and generator functions.
🔍 Asked to write a polyfill for the reduce function (already practiced!).
🖇️ Question on object manipulation (specific details not recalled).
💬 In-depth discussions and arguments on pure functions and currying concepts.

After completing the first round, I was given a half-hour break and asked to rejoin the same link for the next round.

Round 2 (Security and React):

🔒 Focus on web security, including knowledge about attacks and defense mechanisms.
🛡️ Questioned about web security fundamentals, such as common attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and ransomware.
💡 Discussed the security principles followed in my organization and the security considerations while coding on the frontend.
⚛️ Explored React's lifecycle methods and their significance in maintaining secure web applications.
📚 Asked about component design considerations, such as minimizing security vulnerabilities and ensuring data privacy.

✍️ Requested to write a generic memoization function to test problem-solving skills.

I honestly admitted that I was familiar with the terms but lacked practical experience. However, I expressed my willingness to learn and enhance my understanding of security.

Soon after, the HR representative joined the call and informed me that if I were selected, I would receive an invitation for a managerial interview within the next two hours. At that moment, I felt burnt out and uncertain about my chances of being selected, considering my performance in the security-related questions.

Managerial Interview and HR Wrap-Up:

💼 Interviewed by the manager who explained the project and asked about a feature I was proud of.
📊 Provided a detailed explanation and even drew a flow chart to illustrate the feature's flow.
💬 Discussion about conflict resolution within a team and handling team dynamics.
🤝 HR informed me that if selected, I would receive an invitation for the next round within two hours.
