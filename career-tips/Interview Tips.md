# Facebook interview 
Interview Process
----
Here is what to expect in a Facebook interview for software engineers:
  
◈ Recruiter Pre-screen (20-30 mins) - Initial screening based on resume. Questions related to your professional experience, noteworthy projects, and accomplishments. No coding.
 
◈ Technical Phone Interview (45-60 mins) – You will solve a coding question using an online editor. Your interviewer might ask you a follow-up question or add constraints to the current problem. Common topics include data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexity.  
 
◈ Onsite Loop (4-5 interviews) - Coding, design, and behavioral questions.
 ➡ Ninja (coding, 2 interviews) – 1-2 coding questions solved on a whiteboard in 45 mins.
 ➡ Pirate (design, 2 interviews) – Collaborative discussion with the interviewer. Drawing on a whiteboard to solve a system design question. Junior engineers don't get any design interviews.
 ➡ Jedi (behavioral) Questions about your motivation, people interactions, challenges, and work ethics. 
 
◈ Lunch - It's not an interview. The interviewer will show you around and have lunch with you.
 
 
Interview Tips
----
  
1) Data Structures - Practice data structures like Heaps, HashTable, Tree, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and Graph. 
2) Algorithm - Practice recursion, Merge-Sort, Quick-Sort, Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Divide and Conquer, and Dynamic Programming
3) Explain your thought process - Extremely important. Practice describing your solution and design decisions clearly and concisely.
4) Collaborate – Don't forget to discuss, present multiple solutions, and take hints from the interviewer.

### Interview Rounds

Round 1: Few companies have first written round, comprising of MCQs on core Data Engineering topics like Spark, Hadoop, AWS/Azure/GCP, SQL, Hive, etc. along with a few coding questions.

Round 2: Primarily based on SQL. It included questions around-
• All types of Joins  
• Group By
• Indexing
• CASE-WHEN statement 
• Null-Safe Join
• CTE(Common Table Expressions)
• Dealing with duplicates
• Any, All, and exists
• Union operation, Subqueries, Having clause
• Windowing Functions like Rank (), Row_Number() & Dense_Rank()
• Over Clause with Partition and OrderBy
• Aggregation on windowing functions like SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() etc.

DSA is also one of the necessary skillsets for a Data Engineer. Can expect questions from basic/intermediate level on topics such as Array, String, Stack, Queue, Linked List, and Tree.

Round 3: Coding question on Python with a primary focus on Pandas and Data Structures such as List, Tuple, Set & Dictionary. Another important domain is Spark, with questions on-
• How Distributed computing works
• Spark Architecture
• MapReduce Vs Spark

• How driver works in cluster mode 
• RDD
• Lazy Evaluation
• Fault Tolerance in Spark
• Lineage Graph 
• Groupbykey and Reduceby key
• Persistence and Caching 
• Optimization in Spark
• How to tune a spark job
• Repartition and Coalesce
• Partitioning and Bucketing
• Narrow and Wide transformations

Round 4: Based on any cloud platform you are most familiar with. It included questions around-
