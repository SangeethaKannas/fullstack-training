Month 1 - Forget about degrees

Skills are easier to learn now than ever. Pick a high-value service that interests you, learn for free on YouTube, and find advanced courses online. Do this till you’re confident you can get results.


Month 2 - Stop looking for jobs

Once you have a skill, don’t think about money initially. You need to find clients willing to take a bet on a newbie (you), and you can do this only by working for free or dirt cheap. Do this till you have a success story.


Month 3 & 4 - Scale your business

Use your case study to pitch to prospects in the same industry, increasing your prices by 10% for each one. Do this till you can’t take on any more clients yourself, and need to hire help.


Month 4 - Build an team

Hire talented people to help with the workload, and specialists to improve the quality of your services. Do this till your agency can run itself without your micro-management.


Month 5 & 6 - Focus on business development

While your business runs itself (with your oversight), your priorities should be client acquisition, brand building and growing your business. Do this till you build a successful agency, and keep scaling up!
