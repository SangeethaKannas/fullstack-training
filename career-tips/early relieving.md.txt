I am submitting my humble request to have an early relive from the Company. I understand that as per the mutually agreed terms and conditions at the time of appointment, the notice period will be of 30 days and therefore, I am writing this letter to request you to please request this duration from 30 days to 10 days.

This is because I have got a new job in California. As you are aware that I stay alone in New York and my family is settled in California. Therefore, it is a wonderful opportunity for me to stay with my family. But the Company wants to me join within ten days.

I will make sure that I will wind up all the work and finish everything within 15 days. I am also ready to work beyond working hours in order to transfer all my duties. I am very hopeful that you will consider my situation and reduce the notice period to 10 days
