- Object = stores combination of data as key-value pair 
  -- key
  -- Value

- Function
  -- Bunch of code bundled in a section, which runs only when the function is called
  -- allow for organizing code and code reusability
  
  -- Function declaration
     Name of a function
     Parameters | arguments ( optional )
     Function body - Code block
     Return (optional)

### Basic Vocabulary
- Variables
  Variable declartion
  Variable initialization
  Variable Assignment
  
- Hoisting
  
- Scope
    Global Scope
    Functional Scope
    
    Lexical Environment (Lexical scope)
        The physical location (scope) where a variable or function is declared is its lexical environment (lexical scope).
        
Rule:
    (1) Variables in the outer scope can be accessed in a nested scope; But variables inside a nested scope CANNOT be accessed by the outer scope. (a.k.a private variables.)
     (2) Variables are picked up from the lexical environment.   
 Scope Chain
    Nested hierarchy of scope --> JS Engine looks for variables in the scope chain upwards ( its ancestors )
