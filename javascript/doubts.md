  Memoization | shouldComponentUpdate | may result in buggy code as it may create issues in Code Maintainability | PureComponent

Purity = No Side affects
Default React is impure
React is basically a state machine
Declarative system Performance improvements ShallowComparison
Every child of pure component should also be pure
Javascript concepts

1. Coercion

2. Scope - Function Scope
  ES 6   Blocked scope - with let and const

3. True nature of objects  - Prototype and prototypical inheritance

4. this - occurs with every function invocation - how the function is invoked

5. Functions - Functions are firstclass objects - very powerful feature
    Closure
    IIFEs

6. Namespace  Module pattern

Functional Programming

Pure Functions

1. Return same input for same output EVERY TIME
2. No Side Effects, No Dependencies
3. Predictable and Testable

Functions are values
Higher order functions
Composition
eg.,  Filters in arrays, Reject in arrays

Javascript rules
Values have types and those types don't change but Variable can hold any value any time ( does not have types)

== allows coercion | implicit coercion   0 "" undefined null false true
OOPS comparisons
"" == 0,  "" == false, 0 == false, "0" == false,

=== disallows coercion

null and undefined are one and the same	improves performance a lot
Stop using anonymous functions --> given them names especially inside another functions --> Prefer Names function Expressions

Principle of Least exposure - define your variables where it is going to be used
eg. var i in for loop
"Block Scoping" better than manually hoisting variables

Tranpiling

this keyword ,  Call site

4 rules new objects, new call or bind function, self owned object,  otherwise use global (when therei not "use strict"

var self = this --> lexical scoping

typeof --> always return one of six fixed strings

Swap variables in js
1. Using Temp variable
2. Using array destructuing

[a, b] = [b, a]

3. Using Maths Operations

a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b

Using Bitwise XOR operator
a = a ^ b
b = a ^ b
a = a ^ b

Why we dont need a global namespace  : naming issues

<hgroup> element contain

media queries - reponsive UI based on Screen size of the view port

flexbox   - flexpack, flexbox -items
XMLHttpRequest - binary data
   correct state that user credentials are sent to server
HTML 5 element - organize content so that page maximizes a search engine's algorithm

Valid WebSocket instantiation
control what's sent to the server when submitting a form
WebStorage API - data cleared when user closes browser ?
AppCache manifest - valid section of it
canvas - methods used on the context to beghin drawing at a new point
Geo location api - cached data configure ability to use it
Transformation - scale, skew ...
position relative to browser window
iFrame - load content from containing HTML document - sandbox atribute
exception object properties
trasnsition-timing-function - 
layout based on rows and columns
amount of spaces between words

elemnt to 

referent the object that raised the event easily

video element  rendeiring of the element can function in different browsers

regexp characters - denotes end of string

Array methods

	Object literals in javascript are by default associative arrays eg object.propertyName.propertyValue is the same as object[propertyName][propertyValue]



var size = Object.keys(myObj).length;
This doesn't have to modify any existing prototype since Object.keys() is now built-in.

Edit: Objects can have symbolic properties that can not be returned via Object.key method. So the answer would be incomplete without mentioning them.

Symbol type was added to the language to create unique identifiers for object properties. The main benefit of the Symbol type is the prevention of overwrites.

Object.keys or Object.getOwnPropertyNames does not work for symbolic properties. To return them you need to use Object.getOwnPropertySymbols

NPM Dependencies types
	https://estebansastre.com/posts/types-of-dependencies-in-npm/
	https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/
	peerdependencies
	optionaldependencies
	devDependencies
	dependencies


Array methods
	unshift Shift
	Push and Pop
	slice and splice
	concat
	
	
	
	
	Object literals in javascript are by default associative arrays eg object.propertyName.propertyValue is the same as object[propertyName][propertyValue]



var size = Object.keys(myObj).length;
This doesn't have to modify any existing prototype since Object.keys() is now built-in.

Edit: Objects can have symbolic properties that can not be returned via Object.key method. So the answer would be incomplete without mentioning them.

Symbol type was added to the language to create unique identifiers for object properties. The main benefit of the Symbol type is the prevention of overwrites.

Object.keys or Object.getOwnPropertyNames does not work for symbolic properties. To return them you need to use Object.getOwnPropertySymbols

Empty your brain. Write out all the things you have to do on paper. Ask yourself, what has to be done?

2. Figure out what is the end result you want to achieve. If your goal is to produce 10 more sales. What activities off your list will help you achieve those results?

3. Group similar activities together into groups. IE Calls, emails, appointments, etc. 

4. Prioritize the most important tasks that will help you achieve your ultimate goal. Put them first.

5. Figure out an amount of time for each task/group. This is a biggie. Set yourself up for success! If you don't do this this is exactly how your to do list turn into crap lists.

6. Schedule the groups/tasks into your calendar. For example set specific times in your calendar to complete emails. Emails can be the biggest time drain if not scheduled.

7. Plan your tomorrow today. 


    Write code, focusing on a single program unit at a time
    Define tests to measure success objectives
    Test each unit of code
    Debug code
    Apply standard formatting
	
	
Focus on the first input element
mandatory one IP address necessary

Adding these rules as part of jQuery
Missing curly braces
Not understanding type coercion
Strict quality checks --> compulsory

Forgetting var
Not understanding how scopes work
Using eval
Misusing event listeners

1.	Manipulating HTML/CSS directly
3.	Employing methods which are not in sync with MVC Angular
