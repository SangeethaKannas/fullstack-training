/**
 * 
 * Given an array, nums, of n integers, find all unique triplets (three numbers, a, b, & c) in nums such that a + b + c = 0. Note that there may not be any triplets that sum to zero in nums, and that the triplets must not be duplicates.

Example:
Input: nums = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1]
Output: [0, -1, 1], [2, -3, 1]
