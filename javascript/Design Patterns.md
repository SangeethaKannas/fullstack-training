Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our
environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem,
in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without
ever doing it the same way twice. (Alexander et al., 1977, pA. x)
Thus, patterns explicitly focus on the problem within the context

Invocaion Patterns

Function Invocation Pattern
Method Invocation Pattern
Constructor Invocation Pattern
Indirect Invocation Pattern


A method can access its parent object using the operator "this".
The binding of a method to an object happens when we execute the method.

Call() method
	First argument of call() method is object. After second argument onwards are values to the functions being invoked. First argument you pass in call() method can be referred with this operator in function
	Call() method takes at least one parameter.
First parameter is object on which function to be invoked
Second parameter onwards get passed to the function to be invoked.

Apply() method
Bind() method


Method: 

When we define a Javascript function as a property of object then function is known as Methods`
