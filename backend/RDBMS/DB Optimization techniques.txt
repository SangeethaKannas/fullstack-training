Database Optimization Techniques 👇

Each "Technique" optimizes database performance in distinct ways

𝟭. 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴:
- Used to offload read traffic from the main database instance
- Beneficial for heavy read queries like reporting and analytics

𝟮. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝘂𝗺𝗻𝗮𝗿 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲:
- Compression reduces storage costs and improves read performance
- Columnar storage is well-suited for analytics workloads

𝟯. 𝗜𝗻-𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗲𝘀:
Like Redis or Memcached reduces the need to retrieve frequently accessed data from the database repeatedly, improving response times

𝟰. 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀:
- Choose appropriate data types for columns
- Avoid using excessively large data types, as they consume more storage and memory

𝟱. 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴:
For large datasets, consider partitioning tables based on certain criteria (e.g., date ranges)

𝟲. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Distributes data across instances for better query performance
