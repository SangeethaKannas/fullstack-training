What happened during covid-19 times were pertaining to extreme measures for gaining job security. But those times are over now so I won't be doing that, ever again. Besides, it was the company who pressurised me to start the work early so I'm not at fault


 I take full responsibility for the mistakes and I assure you that I am committed to avoid such issues in the future.

 I feel that it is very essential to be transparent and open about any miscommunication that has happened.
