### System Design

Backend Development:

    Foundation: Start with Node.js and Express for the backend, offering a solid foundation for building efficient and scalable APIs.

    Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user access using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring data privacy and seamless user interactions.

    Abstract Base Model: Create a robust abstract base model that serves as a blueprint for your database models, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication.

    Notifications Service: Elevate user engagement through a comprehensive notifications system: Push Notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

    Error Logging: Utilize Sentry or Rollbar for efficient error tracking and debugging, ensuring a smooth user experience.

    Logging and Monitoring: Set up the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack to centralize logging and monitor application health.

    Throttling and Rate Limiting: Incorporate mechanisms to prevent DoS and DDoS attacks, safeguarding your application's availability.

    Asynchronous Communication: Implement RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication, enhancing data flow and system reliability.

    Cron Jobs: Automate tasks with Cronitor or Celery Beat, streamlining maintenance and freeing up resources.

    Secrets Management: Prioritize security using HashiCorp Vault to manage sensitive information effectively.

Frontend Development:
    Framework and Language: Opt for React, a powerful JavaScript library, for creating dynamic and engaging user interfaces.

    Responsive Design: Ensure your application adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes by embracing responsive design principles.

    State Management: Utilize Redux for efficient state management, ensuring consistent data flow across components.

    Routing: Implement React Router for smooth navigation and dynamic content loading.

    UI Design and Component Library: Collaborate closely with designers and you can use component libraries like Material-UI for a polished and consistent UI.

    Form Handling: Simplify form creation and validation with Formik, enhancing the user experience during data input.

    Testing and Performance: Embrace testing tools like Jest .

Full Stack :
    API Integration: Seamlessly connect frontend and backend using RESTful APIs or GraphQL.

    CI/CD Integration: Automate testing and deployment with CI/CD pipelines like GitLab CI, ensuring code quality and rapid delivery.

    Version Control: Use Git for version control to maintain a collaborative development process and track changes.

    Monitoring and Analytics: Employ New Relic for application performance monitoring and gain valuable insights.

    User Experience and Accessibility: Prioritize UX and accessibility by following best practices, making your application user-friendly for all.

    Security and Firewall: Strengthen your production environment with Nginx, ensuring a secure application.

Uber System Design


Scalability:
Uber deals with a massive user base and requires a scalable architecture to handle a large number of concurrent requests. Discuss how the system can horizontally scale by adding more servers or resources.

Microservices Architecture:
Uber typically employs a microservices architecture, where different functionalities are broken down into smaller, independent services.

Geographical Distribution:
Uber operates in multiple cities worldwide. Explain how the system handles geographical distribution, load balancing, and routing requests to the nearest data center for optimal performance.

Ride Matching Algorithm:
Uber's core functionality involves matching riders with drivers efficiently. Discuss the algorithm used for real-time ride-matching, considering factors like distance, traffic, and driver availability.

Real-time Data Processing:
Uber relies heavily on real-time data processing for tracking rides, calculating fares, and managing driver availability. Discuss the tools and technologies used for real-time data processing, such as Apache Kafka or Apache Flink.

Payment System:
Uber's payment system must be secure and reliable.

Availability and Fault Tolerance:
Uber must ensure high availability. Discuss strategies for fault tolerance, including redundant systems, data backups, and mechanisms for handling service outages gracefully.

User Authentication and Authorization:
Security is paramount. Discuss how Uber ensures the security of user data, including authentication mechanisms, authorization processes, and encryption standards.

Caching and Database:
Explain the role of caching in optimizing system performance. Discuss the choice of databases for different functionalities, considering factors like consistency, scalability, and latency.

Monitoring and Analytics:
Uber relies on extensive monitoring and analytics to improve its services.
