## Functions

- What is call method in Javascript?
   Call is a method of an object that can substitute a different object than the one it is written on.

- What is apply method in Javascript?
  Apply is almost identical to call, except that instead of a comma-separated list of arguments, it takes an array of arguments.

- What is bind method in Javascript?
  Unlike call and apply, bind does not run the method it is used on, but rather returns a new function that can then be called later.
