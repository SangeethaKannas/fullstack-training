✅ JS Coding
🔷 Implement findIndex
🔷 Implement intersectionWith
🔷 Implement classNames
🔷 Event Emitter: Create a class that supports event subscription, emission, and callback triggering. Subscription objects are returned and can self-unsubscribe.
🔷 Flatten: Create a function that recursively reduces the nesting of an array to a single level, effectively flattening it.
🔷 Promise.all: Create an implementation of the Promise.all() function that resolves to an array of results if all the input elements are resolved, and rejects otherwise.
🔷 Implement promiseAllSettled
🔷 Implement promiseAny
🔷 Deep Clone: Develop a function that performs a deep copy of a value while handling circular references
🔷 Implement HTML Serializer

✅ Machine Coding
🔷 Star Rating: Construct a star rating component that displays a row of star icons, allowing users to choose the desired rating by selecting the number of filled stars
🔷 Image Carousel
🔷 Progress Bars: Develop a list of progress bars that gradually fill up concurrently, with a maximum limit of 3 bars, and include the functionality to pause and resume the progress.
🔷 Tic-tac-toe: Create a tic-tac-toe game with a grid size of N x N, where the goal is to achieve M consecutive marks in order to win.

✅ System Design:
🔷 Poll Widget: Create a poll widget that is embeddable on websites.
🔷 Image Carousel: Create a horizontally scrolling image carousel component with a responsive design, navigation controls, and an auto-scrolling option
🔷 E-commerce: Design an e-commerce platform
🔷 Chat App: Develop a chat application with features and functionality similar to popular messaging platforms like Skype and Slack.
