𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝘆 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿

- Building and Deploying an application is always a challenge for programmers. Specially if you're programming on different OS and deploying on server with different OS.

- There's always a chance of human error causing our application to not work on remote servers.

- This problem becomes even worse when we're working on real world application with tons of module, DB, third party integrations, environment specific configuration.

- This is where docker enters into the picture:

𝟮. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

- Docker allows developers to build, package, and deploy applications in a consistent and efficient way.

- It provides an easy way to create isolated environments for applications, which can help to avoid conflicts and compatibility issues.

𝟯. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀?

- It uses a technology called "containerization" to achieve this. (But remember containerization is an old technology)

- Containers are lightweight, standalone, and portable packages.

- With Docker, developers can create a container image that includes all the dependencies and configurations needed to run their application.

- These images can be use to deploy the application on any machine or server that supports Docker.

𝟰. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿

- It Simplifies the process of building and deploying applications, and to make it easier to move applications between different environments.

- Docker can also help to improve the reliability and scalability of applications.

- Use different versions of same application with affecting each other in same environment.
