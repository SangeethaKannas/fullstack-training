const message = 'Hello world' // Try edit me

let array = [1, 5, 100, 120, 1034, 5, 100, 20]

//Sort ascending order
for (var i = 0; i < array.length - 2; i++) {  //O(n - 1)
  for (var k = 0; k < array.length - 1; k++) { //O(n - 1 * n - 2)
    if (array[i] < array[k]) {
      // console.log("Before ",array[i], array[k]);
      let temp = array[i];
      array[i] = array[k]
      array[k] = temp;
      // console.log(array[i], array[k]);
    }
  }
}

for ( i = 0; i < array.length - 2; i++) {  //O(n - 1)
  for (k = 0; k < array.length - 1; k++) { //O(n - 1 * n - 2)
    if(array[i] === array[k]) {
      array.splice()
    }
  }
}

console.log("Output", array);
// Update header text
document.querySelector('#header').innerHTML = message

// Log to console
console.log(message)
