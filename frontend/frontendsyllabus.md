#Java Script Training Plan

1. Javascript and web fundamentals
programming javascript applications 

dstct

amts

Security 

content-security-policy.com

content-security-policy - response header  reduce CSS risks on modern browsers

Nodes Vs Elements


2. Algorithmic Challenges
CodeWorks, LeadCode, HackerRank

3. Learn computer science 101
   CS 50 Harvard

4. Study from one book
 You dont know JS
 Eloquent Javascript
 Effective JS
 Javascript Design patterns
 Javascript the good parts

5. Asynchronous JS and DOM  Async JS and DOM     Async await

6. Build Projects

7. Object Oriented Javascript
8. Functional Javascript

Why?
   Reusability
   Personal Performance of programming, write programs faster
	
How ?
   Everything is a function
	Avoid side effects
   Avoid mutability --> Avoid change in place instead replace 
  Persistent immutable data structure  - Structural Sharing
  Immutable.js - facebook 
  Don't iterate --> recurse 
  Don't loop --> use map reduce and filter
  Use higher order functions --> functions with functions as inputs/outputs
    Closures
  Function composition /pipelining 
    ramda.compose, r.pipe
  Flow data through functions --> outputs become inputs become outputs
	
9. Design patterns
10. Learn framework
  React
  
11. Learn testing, Learn a different programming language - Scheme

Resume building tips

[1] Format

Don't worry about searching for fancy, colorful, complex templates. A black&white plain old boring template works.

Recruiters & hiring managers care about your accomplishments and about you, not about the colors you chose for your resume (unless you are a designer or something similar).


[2] Write accomplishments with X-Y-Z

Most of my accomplishments written using as a base the X-Y-Z formula (shared by Google recruiters)

"Accomplished [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"

Follow it as close as possible, but don't be afraid to put your own style into it (as long as you share your X,Y & Z)


[3] Use strong verbs (red 🔴)

Start every accomplishment with a verb in past tense.
- Strong Verbs (Led) >>>> Soft Verbs (Assisted)
- Try to use verbs relevant to the role. For PM I used: Led, Designed, Researched, Prioritized, etc.


[4] Relevant Skills (blue 🔵)

Notice how I don't have a "skills section" full of Product Manager keywords like "cross-functional", "leadership", "prioritization", "Roadmap"?

The keywords in blue are embedded in my accomplishments. I'm showing the context of how I used those skills to help customers, my team, and/or the organization.

I took these keywords from job descriptions I wanted to apply to.


[5] Show your impact (yellow 🟡)

Not every accomplishment has to have impact, but try to add as many as you can. Impact shows that:
- You can do the job
- You can do it well
- You can make a difference

Anyone can "complete a project in time", but not everyone can "complete a project in time by doing xxxxx, and having an impact of yyyyy"

If you struggle to find the impact, think about this:

- What is it that without YOU it wouldn't have been possible? What did it cause (impact)? How did you measure what happened?


[6] Technical Skills (green 🟢)

I write down all the technical skills that I know and can show some 'proof' (a test, a score, etc.). Many of these are taken from the job descriptions I was applying to.

A few things to remember:
- 'sprinkle' tech(hard) skills here and there
- don't throw all of them in a giant skills section
- don't have 🟢 > 🔵 (unless you go for Software Engineer roles)


[7] Other stuff to keep in mind

Length? 1, 2, 3 pages are ok. You may have a lot of experience. Make it RELEVANT, that's what matters.

Tailoring your resume to the job >>>> almost everything else.
Don't submit the same resume to every job.

Triple-check for grammar/spelling mistakes.


BONUS: While I worked on my resume for a while (and there's still A LOT of room for improvement), what got me my recent jobs was the fact that I networked a lot.
Don't underestimate the power of networking.
