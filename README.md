6. Build Projects

7. Object Oriented Javascript
8. Functional Javascript

Why?
   Reusability
   Personal Performance of programming, write programs faster
	
How ?
   Everything is a function
	Avoid side effects
   Avoid mutability --> Avoid change in place instead replace 
  Persistent immutable data structure  - Structural Sharing
  Immutable.js - facebook 
  Don't iterate --> recurse 
  Don't loop --> use map reduce and filter
  Use higher order functions --> functions with functions as inputs/outputs
    Closures
  Function composition /pipelining 
    ramda.compose, r.pipe
  Flow data through functions --> outputs become inputs become outputs
	
9. Design patterns
10. Learn framework
  React
  
11. Learn testing, Learn a different programming language - Scheme
