### Tips
In JavaScript, we normally use 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵.𝗳𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗿 method to get a value rounded to the number less than or equal to the provided number like this:

𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘩.𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘳(𝟧.𝟥); // 𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘴 𝟧
𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘩.𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘳(𝟩.𝟪); // 𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘴 𝟩

But If the provided number is negative, the result is not what you might have expected as can be seen below:

𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘩.𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘳(-𝟥.𝟦); // 𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯s -𝟦 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘢𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘥 -𝟥

This is because -4 is a smaller number than -3.

So to fix this, ES6 has added 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵.𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗻𝗰 method using which you can get the expected result.

𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘩.𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘯𝘤(𝟧.𝟥); // 𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘴 𝟧
𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘩.𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘯𝘤(𝟩.𝟪); // 𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘴 𝟩
𝘔𝘢𝘵𝘩.𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘯𝘤(-𝟥.𝟦); // 𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘴 -𝟥

As you can see the 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵.𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗻𝗰 method truncates the part after the decimal point producing the expected value.

So using 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵.𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗻𝗰 method makes it easy to get a whole number along with the sign with the

#### Regexp
decimal point removed.

/\//ig;


\d matches a digit

[a-zA-Z] matches a letter

{3} is the quantifier that matches exactly 3 repetitions

^ Anchor to match the start of the string

$ Anchor to match the end of the string

So if you use all this new knowledge, you will come to a regex like this:

^\d{3}[a-zA-Z]{3}$
Update:
Since the input example has changed after I wrote my answer, here the update:

If your word is part of a larger string, you don't need the anchors ^ and $ instead you have to use word boundaries \b.

\b\d{3}[a-zA-Z]{3}\b

var numberPattern = /\d+/g;

'something102asdfkj1948948'.match( numberPattern )

var a =  333/2020;

### Obect destructuring
while destructing of objects, default values would only be assigned when the key doesn't exist or value is undefined. If the state is the following

because we are passing an arrow function to the setTimeout. Arrow functions retains the scope of their definition. Hence, when the arrow function will be called then context will be same as sayName function.
