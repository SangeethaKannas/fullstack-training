###
A Sneak Peak into Super Optimized Code in JS Frameworks

React - Fibernode
Angular- ViewNode

Locating value of a property in memory is a complicated process

V8 engines maintains shapes
Transition Chains

Optimization through inline cache
function getX(0){

}

feedbackVector - state shape prop offset
Monomorphic access to objects - single shape will be intenally cached in

Frameworks enforce same shape for fiber and view nodes

Bit Fields for classification React enforces side effects in bit fields

Bloom Filters- NO or May be filters ( Probailitistic filters)

Angular Hiearchial injectors

### Detecting memory leaks
Black box VS code extension

iscover JavaScript memory leaks in real-time with the Chrome DevTools Performance Monitor. Three dot menu > More tools > Performance monitor.

Some resources on memory I'm happy to recommend:

Fixing memory leaks in web applications by Nolan Lawson: https://lnkd.in/gkqcMe4g ~ a great guide to common causes of JavaScript memory leaks, how to identify and fix them using DevTools > Memory > Heap Snapshots.

Find and fix tricky memory leaks caused by detached windows by Jason Miller and Bartek Nowierski: https://lnkd.in/gPnB5hiq - a great primer filled with practical code examples and solutions related to leaks from popups (and more).

If you're looking for a demo with JavaScript memory leaks to try out with the Performance Monitor, here's a good one: https://lnkd.in/g48Y8pKE and this one's good for Heap Snapshots: https://lnkd.in/gDAGzCus

If you're into a quick video tutorial, egghead.io have a good quick video on how to detect memory leaks using the DevTools -> Memory -> Allocation Instrumentation tools: https://lnkd.in/g23A4m3x

Debugging JavaScript memory leaks by DebugBear is also good and includes practical examples: https://lnkd.in/gFUtvbf7

JavaScript Memory Management Masterclass by me: https://lnkd.in/g4fP6bZn - this is on the dated side (~2014) but gives you a deep dive into how to think about memory management with coverage of the sawtooth pattern and GMail's "three snapshot" technique.

In terms of state-of-the-art tooling, Glenn Conner at Meta just released MemLab https://lnkd.in/gSrRbr2H - a testing framework for automatically finding memory leaks.
