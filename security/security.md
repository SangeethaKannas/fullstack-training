# Security Tips and Tricks
𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: The initial step where we determine and document the software needs from users or stakeholders.

𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻: 𝗜n this phase, we architect the system, craft the user interface, and plan software component interactions.

𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴): Developers write the software code in an appropriate programming language during this stage.

𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: The software is checked and rectified to ensure it functions as intended, free of bugs or issues.

𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Post approval, the software is deployed, meaning it's set up in a live environment, available to end-users.

𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Once live, the software requires continuous upkeep, including bug fixing, updates for new requirements, or performance enhancements.
