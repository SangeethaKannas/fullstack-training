<Script async defer />
 - Old Way: Blocks HTML parsing once browser sees script tag ==> Download it ==> Execute It and Continue HTML 
 - Old way: script at end of body: User have to wait longer till HTML dom is created
 - New Way: async: Download source ==> Wait for HTML parsing ==> Execute scripts downloaded. Good for 3rd party libraries   |  Scripts not executed in order
 - New Way: defer: wait for dom to be created --> executes order in the way it is created.
